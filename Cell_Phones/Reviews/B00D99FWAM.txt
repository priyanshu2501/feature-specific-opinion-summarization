Starting to have problems with this phone.  Like freezing up, shutting off and pulling up apps very slow. But it's a great starter phone.

Loved this pHone. Until it started to cut off randomly. It's a new phone,  do I have glitches already?

&#34;HORRIBLE DISTORTED SOUND&#34;  First-pros: For the cost it has a good size screen, easy to use apps, Samsung is a great company, it read my 32gb msd, customer service is polite and speedy in obtaining my refund for my first one...which leads me toCons: When I received my first Ring, which was delivered quickly, I noticed a defect in the speaker that made everyone I sound like a robot and I could hardly hear what they were saying. Music also sounds distorted. So I called Amazon and got a refund and ordered another one. Customer service was great and refund and delivery of new phone was fast, which makes me feel a little bad because due to working very long hours for like two weeks straight I have not had time to return the old one which sits packaged and labeled, ready to be sent out Monday morning. Of course I did say &#34;a little bad&#34;. I'm actually quite frustrated that I not only had to go through the steps of activating a new phone, and anyone who has done so knows the time it takes to do that plus download all their apps, transfer music, etc., etc., but I had to do it all again for the new one WHICH HAS THE SAME DEFECT! so I will have to do this all over again. Luckily Amazon has great customer service, because if not I'd be rantin' and ravin', instead I just wanted anyone who goes to order a Samsung Ring that getting two in a row with speaker defects tells me never to buy one again. So now I have to contact Amazon again and this time I'm using my refund towards an upgrade by purchasing either the LTE or if someone purchases off my wishlist the S3 I can give the refund to that person.Tip to all who read this: I have decided from now on I'm going to skim through ALL reviews of a product for reoccurring complaints before purchasing anything. The time spent doing that may have saved me much time than the time I am spending now, especially if other have already complained about this problem.

Bricked in less than a month and had to return it.Even if this one is cheap, I wouldn't waste your money.

Shipping & delivery was fast! It got here two days than expected. It has a great camera quality and the battery life so far is great (which has always been my biggest problem with phones). Tip** don't charge your phone until it's at least 15% & don't mess with it too much while it's charging-the battery will last SO much longer!

This phone does the job but that is it. It has low memory, freezes a lot, shuts down unexpectedly, gets slower over time and sound and picture quality degrade over time. This is a good inexpensive starter phone that should not even be called a Galaxy. Call it the &#34;Samsung I do not have enough money for the Galaxy so I had to settle for this phone.&#34;

FREEZES UP A LOT

This is a nice looking phone, but the day after I had it activated, it froze and Virgin Mobile could not get it to reset.  I returned it.  Be careful with Virgin Mobile.  Even though I only used the phone for 1 day, Virgin Mobile would not give me a refund or an adjustment.  Amazon refunded my money, but Virgin Mobile did not.  I would not recommend Virgin Mobile!!!.

I absolutely love this phone! I don't know why people are so complaining about this phone. Great value for the money

I purchased my GALAXY RING (Virgin Mobile pre-paid) phone at (...) when they had a sale, and as a retiree who's not particularly savvy where electronics and gadgets are concerned, this has been very user friendly right from the start and easy to figure out and use. And I like that there are several 'font' (print) size settings to choose from (for those like myself who have a hard time seeing very small print). All in all - a nice little phone....and best of all, no contracts. Reception is has been very favorable.

I think Samsung hit the mark with this phone. It is lightweight, good memory if you are not an apps junkie. It functions similar to the Galaxy S III. My husband has one a I keep comparing their functionality difference. It is not 4G and the internet can be a little slow. I don't use this for streaming, I have a Galaxy Tab 2.0 for that. Which by the way it syncs very will with. I did note that the apps crash more than I would like, but not enough to be a real problem. The front facing camera is decent. Over all for what I paid, I feel like I got a great phone with quality service. I am happy!!!

Absolutely love this phone. Its kinda like the s3 just smaller and some stuff different with some stuff in the system

Works great and you can't beat the price. Samsung is a very dependable brand. I will definitely buy a Samsung phone on my next purchase.

I am not a techie and this phone is not user friendly.  Virgin Mobile customer service is the absolute worst - It took over 2 hrs. and I got cut off 7 times trying to get my number transferred from my old phone.  They were able to get my number released from my former carrier and then told me to call them back from a different phone in 2 hrs. to get the number added to the new phone.  Problem (1): CS was going to shut down FOR THE WEEKEND in 1/2 hr.  Problem (2):  Since my number was released from my former carrier/phone, I had no other phone to call them from!  So, I was without phone service for the weekend.  Nice.  Now that I have been using the phone for a couple weeks, I can say that I hate it so much that I would return it if if wasn't such a pain to transfer the number.  Voicemail goes out for days at a time.  When I try to check for messages I get a screen telling me "Unfortunately, voicemail has stopped".  I get that message about internet and Facebook quite often as well.  "Unfortunately, Internet has stopped", and I get ONE button to touch - it says "OK".  Well, it's NOT OK, but I have no choice but to touch OK to do anything else with the phone.

the android phone is all around great. &#8217;&#8217;i love it&#8217;&#8217; nice size even with the single core it's still pretty fast. thank you samsung and all other who where involved when making this great product. Samsung Galaxy Ring (Virgin Mobile)

Great phone. Worth the money. I bought it and it was nice, sleek, and i got it set up in less than 10 mins. Works like a mini Galaxy s III

Works great as a phone and runs apps with no problems. A little smaller than the S3 and needs more internal memory but an extra sd card remedies the storage problem.

Its a good phone. Its not one of the best but its better than those cheap phones. The phone is what I wanted and I love it.

Excelent value, This phone was purchased for my grandson. It dose everything he wanted & more. Would recomend to anyone looking for a good phone & so much more!

Bought it for my mom and she absolutely love all the features, she love it love it love it , nice

I WAS REALLY IMPRESSED.PRICE WAS REALLY GOOD, ESPECIALLY PAIRED WITH THE LOW COST PLAN FROM VIRGIN MOBILE. GREAT FOR ENTERTAINMENT AND KEEPING UP WITH EMAIL.

After 5 months it broke. I held the top button and put restart and now the phone will not turn on, The screen would just blink samsung and now it just blinks the brightness.

great phone for someone like me getting his first smart phone.great price , great deal ! was easy to start up and use , still learning and trying all the features it has !

UPDATE12/27/2013 - After using this phone for a while, I have noticed some things worth mentioning and I am downgrading my review to three stars. I am still going to keep the phone, but I am less impressed over time. There are three things that don't work on this phone: apps2sd, screenshot, and tethering/wifi hotspot. The inability to use all three of those has become an inconvenience, and I think the only way to get around them will be to root it. There is one good thing I can mention, though. The phone has not crashed even once since the one and only crash while I was installing Skype, so I think the update to Android 4.1.2 solved the crashing problem.I wish I had waited one day to buy this because it looks like the Amazon price dropped by $20 since I bought this phone at Radio Shack last night. In any case, so far it seems like a great purchase, even at the higher price.I had my LG Optimus V for three years before the vibrate died and I finally decided it was time to upgrade. I debated between this and the Optimus F3 and finally decided on this one because of the front-facing camera and increased internal memory. The difference, so far, has been phenomenal. The V was my first smart phone, so I have a limited frame of reference, but I can definitely highlight the ways that this phone is better than the Optimus V. Here are my pros and cons so far. Both are based on my comparison with the Optimus VPROS1. It has an LED flash/flashlight. Optimus V had nothing like that.2. It has plenty of internal memory (2GB, versus only 140MB in the V)3. It has a bigger screen. Holding them side-by-side at the store, the difference didn't look substantial, but after using the Galaxy Ring for a couple days, the screen size difference is definitely noticeable.4. It plays video and music sound on both the front and rear speakers. The Optimus V only played sound on the rear speaker, which meant I would have to leave it propped up or face-down if I was listening to something.5. It has a MUCH faster processor (1.4GHz versus 600MHz in the V). I have not seen any lag yet, whereas the V would have a lag of sometimes several seconds when opening an app or the browser. I even had the V rooted and overclocked but it still had lag issues.6. Newer version of Android. I did the Android update as soon as I turned on the phone, so I am running 4.1.2. That will enable me to run some apps that the V just couldn't handle.CONS - I don't have many cons yet but I will update this if anything else come up. The few cons that I have found are why I gave the phone 4 stars.1. Slippery case. The V felt secure in my hand, but this Galaxy Ring feels very slippery and I am constantly worried I am going to drop it. I have ordered a protective case for it just to combat this problem. I didn't need a case for the V.2. Battery life. I must admit that the V had terrible battery life at first too, but there were lots of options for extended life batteries for the V. So far, I haven't found any such options for the Ring. If someone knows of an extended battery available for the Ring, please let me know. With the extended battery on the V, I could get two full days of use before a charge. This one has only been unplugged from the charger for 3 hours, and I have already used 20% of the battery life just by checking email, facebook, reading a news article, and installing Skype. We shall see if it even makes it a full day.3. Crashing. So far it has only crashed one time, while I was setting up Skype, but it is worth mentioning.4. Things are too spread out. This might just be a matter of me getting used to the larger screen, but it seems I cannot reach both the trash can icon in the upper right corner and the menu button in the bottom left without adjusting my grip. I may just have to get used to holding the phone a different way, but so far that has been an inconvenience.5. Once in a great while the speaker sound will sound scratchy. It doesn't stay like that, so it is just a minor annoyance.

It's a very nice phone but I'm not sure if I just got a defective phone or if all of these phones are this way.  I've already had to reset the phone because it kept shutting itself down and I've only had it for a month or so.  Also, sometimes the sound is messed up.  Either my notifications sound will be glitchy sounding or if I'm talking to someone on the phone and it had a glitchy sounding ring, the person will sound the same way (almost like they are scream-talking and they have bad reception).  I'm not sure if that makes much sense, but luckily it hasn't happened since I've reset the phone.  Hopefully it was just a problem that was solved by resetting the phone.I will say though that this phone is very good at speech-to-text.  My last phone would try and translate to another language or just jibber-jabber...this one picks up 98% of my words.

ok i own this phone got it from target for $59 yesterday.i love this phone after just one day, never thought id live without a slideout keyboard.this phone is the best preforming virgin mobile phone i have had.ok on to the pros and cons.pros:1gb of ram(compared to the 256 and 512 of the sliders i have had this is a huge deal!)2 gb of storage another big deal(may be a defective phone specs say 4gb)nice screenhd video recording(may never use but nice to have)front camera(again may never uses but still)dual core cpu according to cpumark(only one core enabled)conswell only one of 2 1.4ghz cores enabled.a odd update glitch were the phone made a odd noise.no other cons yet.will update this review as i go

All virgin mobile phones are a piece of s***! Every single phone I have purchased from them has blown s***ty speakers, they all freeze and re-start constantly. I'm done with this company. I have dealt with them for 6 years and cannot take it anymore. I'm going to spend more money for better service elsewhere. With virgin mobile, you get what you pay for. I got 2 phones from amazon with blown speakers from the moment I first turned it on. It was supposed to be a birthday present for my father and boy did they make sure it got ruined.

I have no complaints whatsoever. This phone is awesome, the interface is intuitive and the screen is sharp. I would highly recommend this phone to any Virgin Mobile customer.

As the title states, this is not a computer. Due to the state of current technologies, a device of such a size is limited in its capabilities.What you can expect:The length of time in which the battery can go without needing to be recharged will vary based on how you use your phone.* If you use it strictly for phone calls and nothing more, you will experience longer battery life.* If you use it for entertainment purposes (e.g. games, videos, internet), the life of the battery will be significantly shorter.Why? Because you are using it as though it were a computer. Such activities require greater processing power which, in turn, requires more battery power. In other words, the more the processor has to work, the more power it needs.I am 30 and I have witnessed the evolution of the cell phone. If you are 15 and you complain about battery life while using the phone as if it were a computer, you are wasting your breath. You cannot play games or watch videos or browse your favorite websites with the expectation of having to plug your phone in only once every 24 hours. I'm sorry, but mobile phone technology has not yet advanced to such a point where it can run on a 4Ghz CPU  and a 1Ghz GPU with 3Gb of dedicated graphics memory and 32 gigs of system RAM for a duration of no less than 8 hours on a single charge. If that's what you want, you may have to wait a decade or so for it. And by the time that comes around, you'll complain, because you were expecting more.You may need to be reminded that only ten years ago, Snake was one of the most popular games for mobile devices.What you cannot expect:The performance of a PC in the palm of your hand.---With that, and having one of these phones, my phone, charging not 5 feet from me, I would recommend this phone to others. I enjoy it and  would definitely recommend it over the phone I had ten years ago.I can only give it four stars out of five, because, even when rooted and with FolderMount running, I am still not yet able to move apps to the "external" SD card. Samsung has seemingly not permitted it as a feature in the stock OS and, even when rooted, it recognizes the internal user storage mounted as the SD card with the actual card being mounted as "extSdCard". The seemingly complete lack of App2SD functionality is my biggest complaint.

I ordered this phone for my fiance and it works great. Its a little glitchy, but other wise a great phone. Anyone who wants to by a samsung Galaxy s2 or 3 but doesn't want to spend 4 to 5 hundred dollars, i suggest you go with the Samsung Galaxy ring. It is just like a mini version of the s2/3.

I used to have the motorola triumph before this phone. Lots of bloat pre loaded apps. The internet is faster and the navigation is great!!! Phone calls and messaging is really slow to load. I'm talking 6 seconds to load sometimes. It drops calls more than my girlfriends kyocera (which is a crappy slider phone). The camera is great and so is the battery life. I can text and use the web most of the day before I have to recharge.Pros:Good navigation, good camera, good battery life, decent priceCons: drops calls, slow to load call log and messaging

I Have owned this phone for about a month now, and I can honestly say this phone is not to bad at all. I feel like its a great standard level smartphone. The storage on this phone is a little less than desired but, easy to get around if you manage you're apps properly. Camera is not much to brag about, however I have had to deal with much crappier cameras in my day so like the old saying goes &#34;Beggars can't be choosers.&#34;The phones overall performance is basic. Compared to main stream galaxys, this phone does not fall short of standard. I will note that every now and then, the phone will either restart on its own, or you'll have to restart it, which can be a pain in the ass, but easily to get over if you have the patients and Virgin's great low pricing plans, i say its wroth investing in.

This phone constantly restarts and gets hung up on the home screen.

Best (albeit low end, haven't tried the high end) phone I've had so far! No cons, other than battery life, but hey something's going to have to power this phone and the battery is replaceable, not like the HTC I had.

on it nonstop bought it for her and the only complaint shes had was the storage is really low.. oh and it shut off a few times.. but its a good phone

There are many complains that I have about this phone.  the first one is that when I'm talking on the phone the voice is kind of distorted, many times I can barely understand what the other people is saying and this is annoying. When I'm listening music the sound is great, but once I'm talikng the sound is bad.  Within the first week that i got the phone  the back button sometimes would not work. The phone restart its self sometimes but it's not too often so I don't have a problem with that.  Sometimes it won't  let me open some apps. I get a message that says that the app that I'm trying to opnen is not responding.Sometimes when I plug the phone to the charger the phone wil not chrage, I have tried using different chargers and it won't charge neither so I'm guessing that it's the phone the one that is not working, so now sometimes I have to use an universal charger to charge my phone.The are good things about this phone. The screen is big and the phone speed is fast. I have seen some reviews that say that they run out of space in the storage but I haven't get that problem, maybe this problem can be fixed if you use an sd card

I bought this for my nephew and he loves it. I just might by one for myself. It is a great phone.

It freezes alot and the speaker is awful.  the looks are nice but not much storage I keep running out of space on my storage.

My Sister loves the phone hasn't had any problems with it even though there is a ton of bad reviews i believe its all on how you treat a phone I would recommend this for a great price an great starter smart phone

I originally wanted the galaxy S3 but I wasn't willing to break the bank for it. My next option was the S2 but I went with this phone instead. It's a great bang for your buck. I would call it the baby version of the S3. I am pretty satisfied with it. The only reason it gets 4 stars instead of 5 is because it has a tendency to freeze up/ restart on sometimes. It doesn't happen frequently but when it does happen it's annoying. If I would have paid more for it, it'd be incredibly upsetting. Otherwise, I would recommend this for someone younger; maybe a first smartphone for a preteen or teen that won't cost you too much.UPDATE: Do not buy this phone, I have only had it for about 2 months now and it shuts down more and more. I've already had to do a master reset, and that was the last straw. I think if it wasn't a single core processor it would function better. I'll be buying a different phone soon than I had originally wanted.

This phone is basically a mini Galaxy S3 smartphone. It has just about all the features of the Galaxy S3. It's a Galaxy class smartphone.Lists of Good things about this phone:1) It's inexpensive ( $69 at walmart )2) Support a 64gb Micro-SD card.3) Can be used like an iPod with out activation. So you can use this to surf the internet and play music and videos without activation.4) You can use GPS with out activation or internet service using apps like &#34;Mapdroyd&#34;.5) Allot of &#34;Free&#34; apps available.6) same size as an iPhone-5,  This phone has a 4-inch screen display7) has a camera8) Plays music and videos well, Streams internet video and music fineList of Bad things about this phone:1) Can only hold about 100 apps because this phone only has about 2gb. of storage for apps.2) No NFC3) Some times drops it's connection in remote areas and area without good coverage.4) You have to charge the phone just about every night.5) Runs out of storage space very quickly so add a Micro-SD card to store your Music, Pictures, Photos, Wallpaper, Videos, Documents, eBooks, etc.6) It's basically a Pay-as-you-go phone so don't expect too much. The only real problem I have with this phone is that it runs out of storage space quickly, Sometimes drops calls, and sometimes reboots on it's own.7) Has GPS8) Has all of Google services.

I like this phone very much. The size is good, where you can see what you're looking at, & still be able to put it in your pocket, center console or on a belt clip.It has the normal smart phone features, is very fast & has a great battery life (all dependent on your apps, of course). As with many phones, there never is enough space to store what you want, & very little goes to the memory card (with out modifications).It is light weight & the blue color is very pleasing. The camera on it is fantastic! I am really impressed with that. The front facing camera is only 1MP. The sound clarity is very good, even with my Koss Pro headphones (see review) plugged in.Connecting it to my car stereo was way too easy, & linked, they work great together. Better than having satellite radio (depending on your app, of course).Every now & again there is a glitch, but all electronic devices have those. The only complaint that I have about it, is the power off button's timing. Press, then press & hold, oops, try again.There isn't much pocket dialing with it, but the lock screen's 911 is a little touchy; good thing it goes to a number pad first.The buttons on the sides are sensitive, & many times I have lost something, by grabbing them. But that's proly more me, than the phone. For an operating system, it's fantastic. The Okay Google assistant is pretty neat, & aside from an occasional oops, right on for getting something done. I'll have to play with it more, to be sure.Overall, I am very happy with this phone & it's purchase. I look forward to doing more with it. Eventually getting wires so that I can plug it in to the tv with a kvm.

I love this phone but hate virgin mobiles connectivity.  The only thing I dont like about it is that I cant figure out how to take screen shots.  Ive read how to online but it doesnt work.  Oh well, besides that I love it.

This phone is really good and it's a very desent price. I believe that this phone is worth its price.. It's good, fast, and doesn't lag

Have heard great things about this phone. Had a mesmerize and was happy with it. Thank you to the seller for a very quick response and shipping so quickly because this is a Christmas present for one of my daughters. Thank you

Rating this is hard because if you take 5 stars to mean say the iPhone 5s or Galaxy s4, well this one is maybe a 2.5.  Then again this one costs $110 versus around $600 and $650 for those.  For best value this is tough to beat.For me the screen is a great size as it fits in my pocket with no issues.The processor is fast but not multi core.  There is a lag getting web pages open even on wifi but it is not bad.  It only has 3g and the processor is fine for that speed.  You'd really want dual core for 4g so you can see the speed benefit over the web.  If you are wanting to be on the web a lot on your phone you would be happier with a dual core and 4g phone.  For me this is fine.Andriod versions are a bit odd in that the newest version is never on any phone for a while.  This is 4.1 and that is the newest widely used Andriod version.  Some phones like the s4 are beginning to have 4.2 now.  The newest actually is 4.3 and that ought to be compatible with apps so this should be fine there.  Andriod can have multiple apps be running at the same time.  Since this is not a multicore processor if you leave things open and running my guess is that reviewers are doing who say the phone freezes up on them.Especially the first couple of days the phone did seemingly randomly reboot several times.  This is because Samsung, Google, and Virgin are all wanting to update certain things on the phone.  The problem is they don't prompt you so you can't just ignore it and reboot later, it just does it.  This really is annoying but it also is not the fault of the phone.

phone is great

I bought this phone because of it's fast processer, and yes, this phone is very fast, but that's about it. It has low memory so you can't play many big games, no 4g (which I knew when I bought it) and This phone is made out of the worst material a phone can probablybe made from, it scratches way to easily. This phone is not worth the speed.

I want to start off by saying this thing restarts CONSTANTLY!!! It's so bad sometimes I can't even use it. That being said this is one of the most tough phones I have ever owned. I have put this thing through its paces and it has survived. This thing has been tossed, thrown, dropped, and submerged in water and still works. It does how ever restart constantly multiple times a day. It lags a lot and locks up from time to time. I've also had it delete my home page apps a few times. Over all this phone is okay.

If you're looking for a high-performance phone or you are an avid smartphone user, then you should probably consider something else. However, if you're a new to smartphones, then it's a perfect starter for the price!I read the bad reviews on this phone, and I was a little bit hesitant to get it but I bought it anyway. It's a pretty nice phone. It supports all of the new apps, has wifi, GPS, nice camera with flash, all for a VERY reasonable price. The only complaint I have is that it will crash every once in a while. This is my very first smartphone so I don't have anything to compare it to, and the crashing doesn't bother me much. I simply restart the phone and continue what I was doing. This doesn't happen very often, I'd say once every couple of months. So if that would annoy you, then I would recommend the Galaxy S3 or one of the other Galaxy devices for Virgin Mobile.In a previous review someone mentioned that this phone gets bad cell reception. That is NOT true. It's not the phone that gets bad reception, it's the Virgin Mobile network that is somewhat lacking.

My wife got this phone a couple months ago. At first everything was fine. Then it started having problems and needing to be restarted. It's gotten to the point where the phone needs to be restarted multiple times per day.Reading other reviews, I discovered that this phone needs at least 400MB of free memory to run efficiently. So I installed Advanced Task Killer to free memory. ATK is the only non-factory default app installed on the phone right now and after killing tasks is STILL has less than 400MB of free memory!

I have had several android phones for Virgin Mobile, I get bored and like to switch around, I figured this one would be Just O.K. It surprised me and actually is a close second to the Galaxy S3, Though it is NOT the Galaxy S3 but sort of comes close, very close. As one reviewer posted, A Poor man's S3. I suggest you purchase a Case for this as the phone, like many others, is thin and slippery.

My daughter loves this phone.  She is having some issue with it freezing up but that could be because she is redownloading all her apps.

If I could, this rating would have 0 stars. This is the absolute worst phone I have had and I paid the original price for it. It has to be rebooted several times a day. It often reboots itself. Each reboot removes any added ring tones. Apps cannot be placed on external sd card. I could go on and on. I previously purchased a refurbished LG smartphone for $25 that out performs this piece of trash. If you value your money, DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!!!!!! By the way, Virgin Mobile has already replaced this phone because it appeared that the first one was a lemon. Not so, this phone is just pure garbage!

Phone cuts off an on . And makes some type of noise when I use speaker phone or listen to music

I bought two of these (for my wife and myself) and both of them reboot randomly and both of them have issues where the sounds becomes static.  They also both will have apps stop loading properly and require a reboot to fix it.I had to send mine in for warranty work 6 weeks after purchase since it froze up and then got stuck in a reboot loop.With that said, when the phone is working it works great. They are responsive and quick to load apps and video.  The screens are good sized and they take decent quality photos.  I just wish they were more stable.

Great timing. It was a birthday gift for my daughter and she loves it. Thank you

Virgin Mobile has been great, and their pricing is hard to beat! Unfortunately, the Samsung Galaxy Ring is frustratingly bad. I've had mine for just over 6 months. About 3 months in I had to ship it back to Samsung for warranty repairs because the phone crashed and NOTHING would get it back online. When I mailed it to them, I included a note asking that they also check the speaker because it would squelch and phone call were often hard to hear. Well, presumably because that wasn't in the initial work order, they didn't do anything about the speaker. Now I can barely have any phone conversations because the squelching is so bad when the other person is speaking. And my only option is to ship it to Samsung for additional repairs. Yeah, that it tremendously inconvenient, not to  mention I still have to pay for the phone service for the 7-10 days that Samsung has it. I own a lot of Samsung products (e.g. refrigerator, two televisions), but I will never buy one of their phones again.

the phone loses charge quickly. a lot of experiences of the phone restarting or closing apps.at times the phone slows down and wont connect to wifi. finally got sick of this after three months and bought a new phone.

I bought a larger sd card hoping it would help with storage problem but that was a waste of money. If u like playing games then this is NOT the phone for u. I can only fit about 4 or 5 game apps on it. Apps will not transfer to sd card. And yes this phone freezes/shuts down at least every 30 minutes of use.A few pros, surfing the web is good. Not too slow and u can open multiple tabs.

I paid 85 bucks afte tax today at your local trash hole wal-mart.  Did I get a good deal? Getting to know the phone.

Works great

The charger is very fickle.  It works sometimes. I took it back to a store and they sold me another charger.  Sane problem

My phone keeps turning off and on by it's self. I really like the phone.

This is my first smart phone. I chose it because of android4.1. I think it is enough performance for me to use and reasonable price.

It's great if you wanna try your options out.Great app features but if you have to many apps then the phone crashes ALOT.

Very good phone for such a cheap price. A little slow at times but very good.

I have to honestly say this is the worst phone I have ever had . Nothing but problems from the day I got it !

Ive dropped this phone a million times, thrown it.. bounced it.. and Im convinced that the screen is virtually unbreakable. My boss called and I threw hard it the other day. It bounced 3 rooms away on hardwood, resulting in no signal strength. The phone itself is scratch free and dent free after about a year. This is one heck of a durable phone.The drawbacks are the keyboard. Plain and simple. The preemptive technology does not function or is non existent on the touch screen.. making texting rather difficult. The spell checker and suggestions can be turned off to make the screen area bigger, but this results in a million typos. The keyboard should send the majority of a button touch, it does not. The other thing was the alarm clock app.. it really should lock the screen from rotating, because when you wake up to hi snooze the thing is scrolling all over the place and you end up literally chasing the snooze button with your finger. The final drawback was a glitch in the music player, which alows the media player to select the default album cover used in all tracks, from your personal photos!!!! There are horror stories of this all over google, as there is no way to erase that default album artThe phone itself is great.. if your willing to experience some difficulty in texting for an extremely well built phone, this is a great deal.. way way better than any LG phone, and nicer than the iPhone. No hardware issues that I know of..

The phone has many many mannny glitches. Freezes and restarts a lot, the memory is low but it's an up to date phone. It was worth the 80 bucks I spent. But galaxy's aren't all they're cracked up to be, also I found my apps that generally worked on my old lg phone didn't even work on here. Photo quality reduces after a while on instagram, snapchat doesn't record videos. Tumblr takes forever to load and some games do not work at all.I ABSOLUTELY DO NOT RECOMMENDED THIS PHONE UNLESS YOU'RE DESPERATE.

Great phone. Only problem I have is that it has a low storage,other then that it's a pretty decent phone.

I have owned this phone for about three months now. I love the screen size, front/back camera, screen clarity, and apps. The price of the phone was about 50 dollars less than what Radio Shack was charging. I received my phone in a timely manner and it was in great condition.

I've been using the Ring for about a month now. I haven't had one problem. I basically use the phone for Twitter, Facebook, Foursquare and texts. I've never been one for a lot of music or games on my phone. Battery life is outstanding. I've never been a fan of all the stock apps Android comes with. But I must say that most of them are very useful. Camera takes really good pictures and is easy to share to social media. I do have Netflix on the phone and the quality is perfect. No lag what so ever. Now for the bad. I'm not able to move some of the apps to my SDcard. Which isn't a major issue. All in all I've been very happy with the phone and would recommend it to everyone.

I had high hopes for this phone but have been slightly disappointed. It's glitchy and I feel as though Samsung just slapped it together. It restarts itself quite often, the sound sometimes changes to static, the camera fails a lot, and settings randomly go back to factory. The processor is fantastic for speed and service is decent but overall I'm pretty irritated with this phone. I bought it in a pinch so I'm stuck with it and will have to learn to deal with my little glitchy piece of Samsung.

I thought I was "upgrading" from the LG elite.  The phone worked fine in the beginning.  After about a month, the phone started to freeze up randomly.  I have to remove and reinstall battery.  When it's working, it works fine, but this is the first cell phone I have owned that freezes up.**Update** 4/10/2014:  Phone worked fine since original review, then froze up again and again in last two weeks.  It finally just froze up at startup..I reactivated my old cell phone. This phone was a waste of money!

It's a great phone I love it

It was low price so i did what i had to do, and i got what i expected so i rate it 1

I would strongly urge you not to buy this phone. After only a few weeks of use, you will begin to have many problems, including:*Difficulty hearing phone conversations and weird screeching sounds during calls*Inability to make or receive calls*Missing voice mail messages*Frequent app crashes*The need to restart your phone one or more times per day to decrease the number of other problems you have.*The phone crashing.*After a while, the phone will begin to crash so badly you have to remove the battery.*My first model of this phone (before it was replaced with a second by Virgin Mobile), got itself stuck in a constant crash and restart loop, preventing me from using it at all.I was so excited to get this phone and for the first few weeks (for each of the two phones I owned), it was great. But then the problems became so bad I couldn't depend on it. We made many, many phone calls to Virgin Mobile to try to work through problems.I was forced to replace the phone, using a credit from Virgin Mobile to help with the cost.I love Virgin Mobile and we've used them for years, but this is the worst phone by far that I have ever used.

Had this phone for 3 weeks so far.Plain and simple opinion is :The camera is pretty sharp.The phone calls sound good. Usingthe internet is quick for searching.The price is budget friendly fora Samsung Android smartphone.Not downloading tons of apps but some of courseand just using it for basic tasks and works great.

No one can hear me talk!

Signing up with Virgin Mobile, using this phone, I am cutting my phone bill in half and getting twice the options I was getting with the Iphone4 and Verizon.  Really glad I made this purchase, since I will save around $500 just this year.

What can I say that's good about this phone?? Hmm nothing.This phone sucks. I hate everything about it and I'm not a picky type of person when it comes to phones. It will freeze it will shut off and it has no memory at all even with a SD card. I bought this phone brand new at walmart for 60 bucks and at first it's nice but after a month it went down hill from there. It takes everything I have inside not to break it. But I will say if you like android and want a s3 but don't wanna break the wallet this is the type of phone for you. It's pretty much a s3 mini.The pros of this phone are: nice camera with flash,Cons: shuts off freezes no memory and does it's own thing.Let's just say I'm getting rid of this phone and goin back to the iPhone ASAP!!!All it's good for is a back up and a plan b

I liked this phone for the usability and the way it felt in my hand.  But, I have to give it a bad review because I could not move apps to the sd card which limits the usefulness of this phone.  Overall, I ended up taking it back and looking for another phone that was made by Samsung but could access the sd card with apps.

sound in for the hearing end of the phone sounds crackly and broken. sometimes i think it gets overloaded and restarts on its own. other times it freezes up and i have to pull out the battery. otherwise texting and pictures/videos work well.

Ima start by saying that I don't own this phone but I do have virgin mobile I'm using the HTC one v I gave a rate of 5 cause the phone looks cool and I want to buy it but I'm afraid in buying another virgin mobile phone cause virgin screw me up when I gotten a new phone the ZTE awe that phone is no good is garbage don't buy it it lost signal and the 3g goes away all the time can't even download no apps from the google play store always an error 927 pops outI can't even see no youtube videos cause it says errot all the time the video stops and i see a tiny circle in the middle i think is call buffering people stay away from that phone ZTE awe is pure waste of money I donated virgin mobile $84 & i herd that this phone the samsung galaxy ring is the same way what is wrong with jelly bean or is it the creater who makes the phones im just so mad at this momment i should it never gotten the zte awe now is just there on the box making dust ima sale it for t least $35 for a monthly plqn :/

I've had my phone for just about six months now, and what a very long and trying six months it has been. From the very beginning my phone would decide when it did or didn't want to work, I've NEVER received my voicemails correctly, it freezes at least once a day, and there have been a few instances where I've had to take the battery out (classic cellphone fix-all) and replaced it only to realize that my phone has gotten rid of:apps, music, pictures, contacts, text messages, caller log, home screen pages, books, videos, etc.  I mean, EVERYTHING was gone.  Since last night I've been dealing with it's constant restart, which only leads to it's &#34;on,&#34; displaying a black screen and unable to do anything with it. I had hoped it would be better this morning, but it is doing the same thing. I am promptly taking it outside to smash into a rock, or back to the store I bought it from to smash it in the sales associates face. This phone is the physical incarnation of Lucifer himself.

bought this phone for the wife and in less then a month it was messing up giving her every error in the book. maybe I got a busted one I don't know but I wont be buying another one

Nice phone, so far so good.. I ordered about 6 days ago and it came today. Everything works well, it is brandnew like it says HOWEVER, only this part in the discription is a lie -  ** "New Sealed w/ Extras! (car kit & case+ screen cloth). Ships from FLorida. Will send after Labor day (on vacation). Please chose 1 of 3 colors, otherwise I will send one on random. (red, tan, or teal)" **Their was no car charger, or case that came with the phone -tisk tisk..  other then that, I am happy with the samsung phone.. I will update in a while after I have had the phone longer and maybe the other items are still in circulation.

HSN had this phone on sale for $99.95 plus I got 15% off for signing up for their email and then sold my old Kyocera Rise to a coworker, so phone only cost me about $40 total. It puts the Rise to shame hands down but it does have some quirks. I have had a couple apps crash and setting it up was a pain but so far so good. If you like a lot of apps, text a lot, or are a gamer than this phone will likely not be for you. Jelly Bean doesn't allow moving apps to SD card so you are stuck with a little over 2gb (operating system eats some of the 4gb total). Pretty silly considering I have a 64gb SD card with 59gb free. Stock Samsung keyboard is a little laggy for speed texters but you can try other options (again using some of your 4gb), I happen to be a slow typer so no problem for me. Processor is only 1.4ghz single core so gamers may want to bump up to the Victory for a few dollars more. All in all this phone suits me and my situation. Music sounds better than it did on Rise, the apps I use and internet are a bit faster, and it has a bigger screen and weighs a bit less so I am happy with it.

This phone is nice, and has great features. It is a little buggy and the apps stop working every now and then. I have to restart the phone maybe once every two days. Other than that, I highly recommend it.

I loved this phone at first but not long after I bought it, the phone started to restart on its own all the time. I've had it for 7 months and it freezes quite a bit. The other day it kept restarting and wouldn't turn on. I had to leave my battery out over night for it to come back on. I wouldn't recommend this phone to many people.

Bought this phone as a replacement. Phone was brand new when I bought it and acted as if it was 5 years old. The phone lasted less than a month and then stopped charging. Don't waste your time or money.

Was ok thought it was a 4g phone and it is 3g.I didn't want t at first but t is satisfactory

Its acting funny already an i only had it for 2 months smh....wow lol i shouldve gotten the other one
