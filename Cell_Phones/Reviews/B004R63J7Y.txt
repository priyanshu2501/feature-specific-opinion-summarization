You are not informed that this is a Smartphone (whatever that means) and it requires a dataplan with Verizon.  The minimum dataplan offered is $30/mo.  The product arrived quickly and appeared to be new.  I bought it for my 15-year-old daughter who said it was hard to figure out how to use it such as saving/deleting photos.  She preferred to use her old dumb phone with no data plan rather than using this phone.  Since it was a birthday gift I could hardly take it away without replacing it with something else.  Since it is considered a Smartphone I returned it so I could invest in a more user-friendly, modern phone (for only $30 more).  She did not need the office functions (obviously).  I personally did not use the phone but I was upset that I was not warned it is a Smartphone otherwise I would not have bought it in the first place.

i was afraid not to get the one i was expecting both in quality and resistance. the price is very good and if there is the same pice again i would order it again.it was for a present and i wanted it to be the practical one for her. the phone is as i wanted.

this is a great phone!!!!wifi, good programs, it is awsome BUT  the battery started to fail with only 2 months of purchase, and the touch screen after 3 months does not work well, we use the phone for an hour and then the batery is uncharge!! it sucks!is a good phone but the battery and touch screen sucks

Phone is OK, running Windows Mobile CE 6.5, have a lot of features, responsive touchscreen, keyboard is good and slide firmly. Screen is bright with a good size (3.2 inch). It has Windows Mobile Office, so you can read/write the standard MS office files.Major drawback to me is that the phone is locked for Verizon. It means you need to activate it with them.When you power-uo this phone it'll try first to login on the Verizon's CDMA network and maybe if you travel to another country it will activate in GSM as Vodafone subscriber (there is a Vodafone chip).But if you plan to use for GMS carriers you should ignore this activation.According to Meir Herz to set the phone to GSM and get rid of CDMA network. Here's how to change it to GSM:- Put your GSM chip, power it on, ignore the Verizon activation.- Tap start button > Settings > Personal > Phone > swipe your finger to the left or right until you get to theNetwork page.- Tap the mode of operation field, select GSM/UMTS.- Tap OK.Your phone will now work on the GSM network. So it is unlocked !I followed this and it worked. Same for non-US GSM carriers.Other minor points: the screen easily gets the fingerprints marks, so maybe plan to buy some screen proctectors; device is a bit heavier but not too much.That's all for now, if I got any important info I'll update the review.Enjoy !

This is false advertisement. The Lg Fathom VS750 DOESN"T work on ATT phones. I j ust open my package this morning and the phone will not work under ATT service.

I ordered this phone for my girlfriend and we were excited to get it in mail within one week. Phone looks elegant and good for some 90 bucks. However the greatest disappointment is DOESNOT work with t-mobile. We asked the guy in verizon wireless and he replied "there is no way you can use verizon phone with other carriers". Waste of some time and unwanted torture. IT's JUST A VERIZON PHONE.

The LG VS750 does work with my AT&T; SIM card, with setting at either of 2 GSM modes.  I have no problem getting phone service, but I am having trouble with 1) retrieving my voice mail and 2) sending text messages, even though it detected and dialed the correct numbers, *86 and +1 (312)314-9800, respectively.  AT&T; customer service confirms the numbers, but can't help further since this is not their locked AT&T; phone. Can anyone out there help?Bought it because I plan to use it with a local SIM card in my upcoming travel to Thailand and Indonesia.  It's great for my simple needs since I am a light user on AT&T; Go Phone plan.  The good: Wifi works, therefore access to my hotmail and ocassional web browse of CNN.  The photo player and music player work, and can also sync/transfer these files from your PC to the phone's internal memory or micro SD. The camera is quite good, but I am a more serious photographer to stoop this low.  For similar reason, I don't care for the phone's GPS and subscription fee to find out if it works. And not interested in any data plan either to explore 3G and other services. Not using this to replace my laptop for heavy duty web browsing and e-mailing on Wifi.Yes, it meets and exceeds my needs less the 2 minor problems. Overall this is a bargain: price, style and nice LCD screen, etc.Update:  I've since learned through an AT&T; forum that AT&T; switches off the simple voice mail feature from your current plan and changes to visual voice mail because it's a smartphone. It's an extra cost feature of course. Other AT&T; users are experiencing the same problem too when switching to different smartphones.  The work-around to retrieving your voice mail is to dial your cell number using a land line phone, and when you hear your own greeting, press * (star) and the pin/password.  The text messaging is still hit and miss.

The phone would not boot completely. I had to remove the battery several times to get it to shut down.  The two times I did get the phone to turn on all the way, the windows operating system was slow.  I also did not like the company who sold the phone through Amazon.  They called me to tell me I needed to remove my by review of the item.  That it wasn't fair to give them a low rating because they only sell the phone, they didn't make it.  The customer service rep was rude and demanding.  Blamed everything on Amazon and the phone maker.  Not even a sorry for your inconvenience.33

I purchased an LG Fathom VS750 Verizon phone Unlocked GSM Worldphone with 3.2-Inch Touchscreen, Slideout QWERTY, 3.2MP Camera - Unlocked Phone - US Warranty - Black  (purchased on 11/23/2011)by LG.After giving a family member the phone as an early Christmas gift, service turned on by us, she notified us a month later that the phone no longer works. I now have to get the phone back from her, return the phone too Amazon, and hope  that it is still under warranty.Sincerely, Susan

the phone is really very good, and i like it, it have many useful functions and do not cost expensive..

es un producto de muy buena calidad que funciona a la perfeccion me llego en buenas condiciones y en el tiempo prometido he comprado otras cosas al mismo vendedor y estoy contento.!lo recomiendo!

It is a brand new phone it is sweet and it is black it comes with a stylus like it says and its come in verizon you have to acrivate it your self! And i Like the phone and i hope u do to

I just received this phone yesterday. Everything looks fine. Accept that after 8hours charging, IT WOULDNT TURN ON. Any ideal? or should i return this

I develop apps for Windows Mobile 6.5, and this device has a huge configuration, speed, performance and compatibility.  I suggest you getting one if you use WM 6.5.

It is one of the latest Windows Mobile 6.5 phones available in the market. Old fashioned? A little bit, Bulky? May be, Boring user interface? Yes, but it can be easily fixed, so, Why one should buy it? Below my reasons:- First of all, The Company I work for only allows synchronizing Outlook with Windows and Nokia devices.- I've already have a GPS software which only runs under Symbian and Windows Mobile OS.- I'm not a "blackberry guy" so the big and useful slide-keyboard comes really handy.- The user interface can be upgraded to an attractive one. The first step is to upgrade it to the V7 software through the Verizon website. If that's not enough, just install the SPB mobile shell along with the Sense UI. The result: A full packed android like device that costs only 90 bucks!!I also love the good quality camera, processor speed, GPS performance, call quality, WVGA resolution, the "n" WiFi and the embedded software such as the one called "gallery". SPB shell adds more fun and usability to the package making it a really good deal.Since nothing is perfect these are the cons:- Accelerometer performance: Sometimes it turns the screen when it's not supposed to, and the other way around.- Memory: I'm a technology junkie, so after a couple of weeks I run out of memory. I've already worked it out using SKTools software. Enough if you are an average user.- Microsoft no longer supports Windows Mobile 6.5!!!!!  But, don't panic it only means you won't be able to back up your phone info using "My Phone". You can still download apps from the windows marketplace app.

For the price,  I am really impressed with this phone. With some tweaking I have gotten it to the point where WinMo is no longer annoying, but it is still a horrible operating system. The OS is by far the weakest point. The touch screen is one of the best resistive screens I've used, and the hardware is decent, but not solid.

This is the best Windows Mobile phone I have ever had, period. All the bugs and kinks have finally been worked out, and the phone even has a task manager hard button! (WM does not kill programs when you exit they just go to the background and eat up resources. You have to go into the task manager to kill programs) It is also the fastest WM phone I've had also. I hate Android and OS, don't even get me started on Apple products....... I have had smart phones since they started making them and I have always preferred Windows. My first unlocked phone was the Motorola Mpx220 (old school).Windows 7 is great but it doesn't even support the landscape view, yet. So I'm sure it will need a million updates and tweaks before it get's worked out. Anyway this is Microsofts greatest scam anyway. once they fix all the bugs in any operating system, they start from scratch again.If you like gadgets and like to keep up with the Jones's this phone is not for you. For the smart phone power user this is the best WM phone. I do everything from my phone from writing reports and e-mails for work and my small business.For instance  I have already made a power point presentation right from this phone then synced with my laptop and even my PC (which is at home) from I94 during rush hour on the train on my way to work.My only complaint is the camera sucks !!! My last phone was the Xperia X2, which turned out the be a great phone after I rid the phone of all the Sony Ericsson software that ruined the phone and it had a 5MP camera. I almost never used my digital camera after I started to use the phone. Compared to $700 that I paid for it the day it was released (and it still sells for around $300) this phone does it all minus the radio, picture quality, and direct video output (which I never used, because I could never keep up with the cord) for $100.Still using the phone as of 11/17/2011. It freezes up periodically but after I updated the sofware it started to work great again.. I also forgot to mention because this is a world phone it works on CDMA and GSM networks. I went from Verizon to AT&T; to TMobile pre-paid. No more contracts and overages, mysterious/surprise fees and that pesky fee of the month fee.

This phone has GSM and CDMA capacity so good for international travel. Great keyboard. I used mine for three years until the screen would no longer work. Hated to give it up, so am saving it for when I travel again. I can still use the keyboard functions and can make calls, send messages, check email using the keyboard.

This is a very nice phone and i would love it if i was on verizon, but im on t-mobile the phone worked for calls and texts and data wifi data too. However there is no 3g data with this phone on t-mobile or picture mesageing. I personally like windows phones am useing wm 5 now on a tmobile wing. the phone itself was very nice built, great keyboard, screen was as good if not better than wife's optimus. if i could of had better luck with the mms setting and 3g data I would of keept it but sold it to a verizon coustomer who was  very happy with it. Why cant t-mobile have a phone like this a buget phone with nice full keyboard like on this one, one other thing is this is running wm 6.5 that has limited free apps, so if you are a app junkie  this is not your phone, but if you want a simple to use, phone texting web surfing  full keyboard device this is it,

tried to get bluetalk to unlock my phone because it locked back and they sent me an e-mail and "told me to contact LG directly" They would not help futher . Will never buy electronics from Amzon again

I did not like this phone at all. It is very, very hard to use. It is the worst cell phone that i have ever owned.

Bought this a few months ago.Suffered through not getting mms (video) messages.It all had to be programmed manually. Now,if I make a call,and the robot on the other end says 'If you want this or that press 1',and I press the number one the tone starts--and it won't stop!The phone keeps on screaming,until I hang up.Yep...junk.

very good, soy de Venezuela, compre este telefono y funciona perfectamente con mi linea GSM Digitel, buen Telefono, robusto, bastante rapido, me gusto bastante.Se le pueden instalar gran cantidad de aplicaciones, la conexion a internet es rapidisima con mi wifi,La unica contra es que no se le puede poner el software en espa&ntilde;ol, pero no es mal de morirse, igual le doy 5 estrellas...

This phone is constantly breaking!! Turns off for no reason all the time.its also not user friendly.Always better to stick with android or iphone and not try to go cheap (although this phone is not so cheap)I gave it to my mom a couple of months ago and its been really bad. Just logged in for a review (which I never do, but also do use reviews when I buy products...so I think its fair other potential buyers are warned).

Quick Review:Pros:-Awesome Touch Screen-Solid feel, and materials are very nice.-Keyboard is awesome. Spacious, and keys are nice.-Camera is good.-Call quality is great.-Works on T-Mobile.Cons:-MMS messaging service is crap (with tinkering can be MUCH, MUCH better)-Battery life is okay. Not a big con, but could be better, I think.-Windows Marketplace for apps sucks a big one.-Alert/Notifications lack customization beyond stock sounds (with the exception of ringtones).Overall, I would recommend this phone.Long review:I recently bought this phone (unlocked) and I use it on T-Mobile. After about a week and a half of use, I can easily say I love it. Since it is unlocked, all I had to do was put my T-Mobile SIM card in the slot and turn it on. The phone recognized it and automatically connected to the T-Mobile network. Right away I was able to import contacts (from my SIM card), call people, and text message out of the box. However, getting the MMS (multimedia messaging service, being able to send picture/video messages) was not so easy to get working. I spent a great deal of time looking around on the internet to find a solution, and I finally have it fully functioning on T-Mobile! I will describe the additional steps I had to take later in the review. Now, on to the rest of the phone. The phone is quite solidly built; no flimsy plastic parts, and the slide out keyboard has a little spring/kick to it (I like it). The touch screen is not capacitive, it is touch resistive, and so it does require a little pressure in order to work properly. It takes a little getting used to, but after a little bit, weird it is not. The screen is actually very responsive and there is very little to no lag at all when in use. Also, because of the resistive touch screen, a stylus is included. First thought of a stylus would be: "What? A stylus? Please, that is soooo old!" In all honesty, I actually like the stylus. It makes me feel fancy. Plus, the stylus has its own little compartment built into the phone itself! The screen itself is very nice! Colors look very good for such a small LCD screen. The phone is not super thin, due to the slide out keyboard. With that said, at the same time it is by no means fat or brick-like. When in my pocket, I don't feel like my pants will suddenly and randomly be pulled down due to the weight of this phone, which leaves me content. Also, I wear a belt, so that may help a little bit. Other physical features of the phone include everything mentioned in the ad/description for the phone itself. There is a lock/sleep/power button on the top. A memory expansion slot, a volume rocker, a 3.5mm headphone/audio jack, a camera button, and for some odd reason, a task manager button. I'm not too hot on the task manager button, I find I often get it confused with the camera button (they are quite close); however, you can easily disable it within the Windows Mobile settings (or assign it to your biddings). The three buttons on the front of the phone are nice to have. I find that I rarely use them, but I don't find them a nuisance so I could really care less. On the front, the metal (or whatever material it is), is interesting to say the least; it has this weird line design on it, but I don't mind it. The physical keyboard is really nice. The buttons are very nicely spaced and not insanely tiny. The space bar is in somewhat of a weird spot, but it is easy to get used to. For the price I bought this phone for, (brand new, $90), I am amazed at the amount of features this phone has! It has Wi-Fi connectivity, a GPS, a 3.2MP camera, and a touch screen! Thus far, I am still trying to get the GPS to work. I do not have a data plan, so I really like the Wi-Fi feature. The 3.2MP camera takes really nice photos, and the video is great but not HD. I really wish a flash was included. The phone is also Bluetooth capable, which is a plus if you have Bluetooth accessories.  For internal hardware, this phone also is quite amazing for its price. It has a 1GHz processor which for a phone isn't too shabby at all; my iPod touch 3rd gen (32GB) has an 833MHz (around there, but it is under clocked by Apple) for comparison. For RAM, this phone has 256MB on board, which is okay for some, but personally, I think for a phone this is more than enough. Being a "Global" phone, or whatever, this phone is not only CDMA network compatible, but also GSM capable (which allows it to work on T-Mobile, and AT&T; for example). The fast processor really shows in overall smoothness of the OS, and in apps. This leads me to the next part of my review, the OS and apps. The Windows Mobile 6.5.3 OS is not the best OS out there compared to Windows Phone 7, iOS, and Android, but it is certainly not the worst. I found at first it to be a little confusing, but like so many other features of this phone, change takes a little time to get used to. Now I find the OS to be quite user friendly and very easy to navigate around. Some parts of the OS are nice, like the main welcome screen, but other parts are a little quirky. For instance, you can select any sound (or song with a simple edit in the OS registry) for a ringtone, but you are limited to the crappy stock sounds for all other alerts/notices like SMS and MMS notifications. I found with an app I found online (Ringo) you can select a custom text message alert tone, but that's it. Kind of a downer if you are really into customization. I'm quite sure that there is a way to have custom tones for notifications and such, but I have yet to find the way. You can set a custom wallpaper, custom ringtone, and custom themes. The phone also features voice control, but I have yet to figure that monster out. The phone comes stock with Internet Explorer, but as on my computer, I simply cannot stand any form of Internet Explorer; I can say I dislike it with a fiery passion. Luckily, there are many other browsers that are much better, and faster than IE. I easily found a mobile Opera build for Windows Mobile which is very fast and easy to use. For apps, I would not say you are extremely limited, but I will say you are limited. The windows marketplace included on the phone I found was extremely crappy, and I would stay away from it. All the apps on it are for the most part overpriced (for what they can do), and with a simple google search, most of them can be found online for free. Installing apps from a computer is super easy. All you have to do is download the .cab file from the internet (for whatever app you want to install), hook your phone up to your computer, and drag the .cab file from your computer to your phone. Tap on the app on your phone, and install. That easy. A little longer process compared to Android and iOS, but the Windows Marketplace sucks. Now on to what a lot of people who purchase this for T-Mobile gripe about, the MMS service mess. The included messaging service on the phone sucks; it's clunky, awkward, crappy, and too many menus/steps to send a single message. I do not think I would have gotten this phone to work properly on T-Mobile without the help from "Pizzaboy192". Look him up if you run into trouble with your Fathom (concerning messaging problems). What I had to do to get the MMS messaging to work properly to was install some software that removed the "PowerMedia, or Arcsoft" SMS/MMS app that came with the phone. So the SMS/MMS app was removed, which left the native Windows Mobile SMS service on the phone (I believe T-Mail). I had to install a couple other things in order for the MMS service to be used on the phone. Once everything was applied, it was very easy to adjust/edit the GSM SMS/MMS server settings in order to get the phone to correctly communicate with T-Mobile's services. It all sounds super complicated, but in fact reality was not. Simply applying a couple .cab packages was all that had to be done. If you have any questions on this process, contact me at: keeganpmjones5@gmail.com . I am, however, not to be considered "Tech Support" in any way. I can answer simple questions that I can answer. I also cannot guarantee anything. I can give you advice and only advice. I am simply someone else on the internet, not an employee for LG, T-Mobile, etc. Overall, this phone is an insanely good deal at this price. Just be aware that as this phone is intended for Verizon, getting it to work correctly on other networks will require some tinkering but IS NOT DIFFICULT AT ALL. ALL THAT IS REQUIRED TO GET IT WORKING IS PATIENCE, A LITTLE TIME, AND BASIC COMPUTER KNOW-HOW. I would recommend this phone to anyone who wants maybe not a super fancy phone, but a good solid phone. I love it.

Very good phone although I have only 2 weeks with it, is very good and windows mobile 6.5 with excellent works very well, besides being touch and hold your keyboard virtual keyboard is execional physical when you use the touch or when you need used for x reason the physical keyboard is the solution there, the wifi works excellent your connection, plus I install SPB mobile software is a software interface to change the screen layout of windows and icons. In order to recommend the team is excellent and do not forget one of the few 3G phone which has a 1GHz processor speed that makes your operating system for all its work velosmente interface.

I got this phone working on T-Mobile with a $10 sim and a $10 prepaid account--no data.  To set it up, I went into settings, GSM, PAP Authentication, turned off CDMA. Somewhere I found where to select T-Mobile as the network.  You still get a Verizon splash, and some things seem hardwired to Verizon.I can connect to my wifi router.  I can make and receive phone calls.  I can receive SMS messages, and can reply to them but have not yet been able to send an original message to an email address, or to a phone--#########@tmomail.net.I downloaded a few apps from the Microsoft Mobile phone store--there aren't many that look appealing.  The AP ap worked, one for Wikipedia didn't--always got an error when you tried to search.It seems moderately powerful for the price.  I don't have a lot of use for data away from my wifi router, but at some point will try out T-mobile's $1.49 a day mobile plan.Edit: I did get mobile browsing to work with T-Mobile's $1.49 per day data plan.  For a skinflint with few phone or mobile data needs, this can be a very powerful phone for a very low daily operating cost.PS: no problem sending SMSes or emails--the phone just takes some getting used to.

this phone worked great for about 90 days with atnt. turned it off one day then back on latter and it goes straight to Verizon. i checked the card in another phone and it works fine. anybody know why.

I received this phone about a week ago, i was very excited. After turning it on i just switched from the Global Mode to GSM/UMTS and it connected automatically to the local cellular network (in this case Beeline). Although the phone has resistive display, it's really very sensitive. The screen is very colorful, 256k of colors do their job very well. Phone plays 720p HD videos really neat. Foreseeing all of the pluses and minuses the price is a big plus for me. Who cares if it's working on Windows Mobile 6.5.3 which isn't maintained any more. There're still awesome apps and games for this phone, like a PSX emulator or Huff and Puff (Angry Birds alike game) or even Zuma Delux, who doesn't like it?!Great job LG thanks for this phone :)**Update**After a while i decided to update the system from V5 (which comes preinstalled) to V7, which made phone even more awesome, with newer software, android-like home screens and many more. But you need some tweaks so that programs do not kill themselves, Google for the patch.

This was a great phone, lots of good features and easy to use. While it was suppose to be unlocked, it always wanted to connect to verizon to activate. I struggled to get it right but no luck. Had to return it, which is why Im here to find another phone.

I absolutely HATED this phone. I purchased it as a gift for my husband. It is very very very slow. So if you want a phone with speed this isn't the phone for you. He used it for about two weeks and then we sold it to someone else ( Don't know why they wanted it). I would NOT recommend this phone for anyone.

When I first go this phone I was excited. Then I went on to the internet-IT IS SO SLOW. Not only the internet-THE WHOLE PHONE ITSELF. This phone is also heavy and i suppose not that pretty either. Its also a pretty hard phone to figure out. Also the camera on the back gets this pink strip and it happened on my mothers too (we both got the same phone). I wouldn't recomend this phone unless your just a person who needs a phone and doesn't care how slow the phone is or stuff like that. Hope I helped! :)

this phone is awesome... i like it but it is not an android i should have read the description but if you want a phone made for talk text and internet, then this is your phone

This phone works perfectly in Costa Rica. You just need to use the instructions provided by one of the reviewers in this page in order to unlock it. It is actually very simple, I currently have it working with the "ICE" operator. Great phone, great price.

After two days of activating the phone, its systems began to shut down started with ringing which I don't know when someone is calling, 2 the speaker stop working unless u use ear pies. 3rd day, the whole system freezed and never come back despite how many times I removed the battery and restarts it. It does not have reset, does not work with Microsoft windows. The fake phone is on 0.99 % good, just it hooked up with Verizon wireless in one setting. Other than that, its 99.1% useless and I lost my money cause, I thought of returning it but the little pressure I put on the screen shattered the glass like car door window glass. That phone is real fake. Johnson

I purchased this phone to use on the T-Mobile network without a data plan.  Setting up the phone is simple and works the first time.  Voice, Text, WiFi, Voice Mail without a problem except sending pictures.  Took me awhile to figure it out, but it seems to be working now.  Here are the instructions.  Works on my phone, hopefully yours too.  It should also works on AT&T; as well with AT&T;'s settings.  All settings here are for T-Mobile network.Step 1.  Create ConnectionGo to Settings, Advanced, Connections, Connections.  Tap Advanced tab and Select Networks.  Click New.  Under Modem tab, click New.  Connection Name can be anything.  Select a modem: Celluar Line(GPRS,3G,HSDPA).  Click Next.  Access point name: epc.tmobile.com.  Click Next.  Click Finish.Tap Proxy Settings tab and make sure "This network connects to the Internet" is selected.  Click OK multiple times to exit the connection settings.Step 2. Download AppGo to Marketplace and download a free app call SKTools.Step 3.  Configure T-Mobile MMS settingsLaunch Registry Explorer.  Change value for the following registries.HKLM\Software\ArcSoft MMS UA\Config\mm1\MMSCSetting\VerizonMMSC\MmscURI --> [...]I added these values but may not be necessary.HKLM\Software\ArcSoft MMS UA\Config\mm1\WspHeader\From --> {your phone's 10 digit numbers}HKLM\Software\ArcSoft MMS UA\Config\mm1\WspHeader\mdn --> {your phone's 10 digit numbers}I think that's it.  You may need to restart your phone for the settings to take effect.  Let me know if it works for you.

This phone is amazing. The quality of its 3.2 iinch screen and response to touch of its resistive touch screen, its just wow. For the money I dont believe there is a better phone on the market. Nicely done LG. Also on a higher note, the battery life is amazing.

Using this phone as a gsm carrier is pretty good but has its downfalls...I've just bought it and I use AT&T;In order to make the phone recognize as a GSM carrier and not a CDMAGo to settings>personal>phone>slide tabs till you get to networks and then select GMS.The connection on this phone sucks. Especially for texting/calling. It drops bars like nothing. I get 4 bars 1 second then the other its no bars...I recommend this phone to not be used as unlocked. If your gonna use it use it for verizon and verizon ONLY

hola amigos de latinoamerica soy venezolano, dejenme decirles que este telefono funciona muy bien con las tres operadoras de mi pais , ademas es 3g y esta totalmente desbloqueado,el unico inconveniente es que lg lo dise&ntilde;o exclusivamente para verizon por lo tanto el sofware operativo viene totalmente en ingles, pero eso es lo de menos porque le instale un sistema de interface SPB SHELL MOBILE 3.5 en espa&ntilde;ol con lo cual estoy muy satisfecho. se los recomiendo por el precio

about seller : so this is not sold by amozon it is by 3rd party .i bought it for 99$ when the note below the product was only 6 items left and just two day after i order it was marked down to 89$ and note disappeared. so this guys will fool you into buying.About the phone:It runs on win 6.5 which as all say is no more supported by microsoft and i have no problem as long as the phone has good battery life and basic functions .Pros: cheaper that other phones with WIFICons:no web browser with video and flash support. you need a youtube app with bad search resultsless RAM- the worst thing i noticed with the phone was it has only 211 MB RAM and 175 to 190 MB are consumed by the phone to function. you are left with 7 0 to 50 MB to use for browsing so dont expect speed with anythingtouch - bad response specially at corners

No need to activate the Verizon Fathom VS750 phone with Verizon.I followed the instructions on Changing Networks with YourLG FATHOMTM Global Phone (Page 35) in the User Guide, and changed the network to GSM. Then, I turned off/on the phone again, the activation message was gone. The phone is working with T-Mobile prepaid.Google "LG_Fathom_User_Guide.pdf" for User Guide.

I got this for my uncle in India and it never worked even once. it crashed the moment it boots up. Useless phone.

I am on att and my feature phone stopped working correctly and they wouldn't let me get a replacement for free which they are supposed to. anyways i got some amazon gift cards for my birthday so i bought this phone.  The delivery was very fast( i have amazon prime) and all i had to do when it got here was open the box put my Sim card in and change the network setting from cdma to gsm. After an hour or two the interface started to bore me so I googled skins and or themes for windows mobile 6.5.3 and alot of results came up. well i tried a couple they were OK i guess. Anyways while I was searching for all things lg fathom related i came across a website that lets you download a few files and lets you run android on your phone from a micro SD card.  Ok so now that i have told you about that lets get to the review itself.This phone does so many things( with or without android running on it) and I think I will start with the battery.  The battery is OK, I get a few hours of use out of it with the WiFi turned on and a little longer with it turned off.  The screen is very good, the specs sheet says 480 by 800 and has 18 bit color (262,144 colors) but i think it looks better than that.  There is 211 MB of ram available to the user, and this has a l GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon S1 QSD8650 processor which makes this phone very speedy when using multiple applications or when having alot of tabs open in the web browser. Speaking of the web this phone connects to 802.11 b g and n wireless networks and it works on CDMA in the 850/1900, GSM in 850/900/1800/1900, WCDMA 1900/2100, the high speed data technology includes 1xEV-DO rA plus HSDPA.  Were I live I get HSDPA and it sends text messages and connects call much quicker than at and ts regular 3g.  The camera on this device is ok it is 3.2 megapixels which is pretty good considering this is a phone.  This phone has bluetooth 2.1 and it also has a headphone jack so you could listen to music through either one.  The lg fathom also supports mass storage when connected to a computer, which also means it can be synced with windows media player.If you click on this link [...] you can download the files that you need to run android.By using battery saving apps and lowering your screen brightness you can be more battery efficient with android than with windows mobile.  The good thing about putting android on the fathom is that it is pre-rooted so you can instal any of the apps in the android market from the get go.  I personally like android on the lg fathom better because it lets you customize your device more, it has a much larger app store and it is faster than windows mobile 6.5.3.Also I did not make the files and are in no way associated with the maker(s) of the files. So please dont ask me for support you install the files at your own risk.

Please tell me if i shall buy this Phone i want to use it on GSM will it work? is the screen ok? does everything work fine?

The phone is a good it's just that you can not use the MMS for pics. I wish they would tell you that. I am on Tmobile and text messaging, internet and calls are great... You just can't use the phone for anything but calls, simple text and internet. If you know how to create apps then you may find a workaround for the features. I was able to upgrade the Windows 6.5 v5 to V7 from the LG website. I like the phone its fast  but with limited functionality. I just wish I would of seen that information from other reviews, if they were there then I missed it. I'm going to keep the phone because you can't beat the price and will look for a phone that will allow all types of MMS services. If you want a phone that will make calls and use the internet this is the phone for you.  Beware of Windows OS.....

all the features i expected is there. touch works fine, battery is OK. the device is thick specially after i put the cover but this is because it is sliding.

I just purchases this phone and is not unlock I would like to know how could this phone be unlock if I purchase the phone unlock. I would like this information soon as possible.  I need a phone rush

Funciona exelente en ecuador 100% recomendado y super economico aprovechen este gran precio ademas pueden cargarle el sistema android 2.3 gingerbread y juegos de play station one PSX gracias a su procesador snapdragon de 1Ghz ARMV7, el touch del telefono no es muy bueno pero su teclado lo recompensa qwerty.....saudos

This phone is loaded with features and seems pretty decent. I placed my SIMM in it and followed the directions to get it on the GSM network. I was able to make one phone call and every call after that went straight to a Verizon operator asking for a calling card, or other form of payment to pay for the call. If you want an unlocked phone for Verizon, this looks good. It will not work on the U.S. AT&T network as advertised.

But it's not compatible with Windows 7,I need use my netbook with XP for Sync messages.Good Keyb and screen

is not activating to tmobile i mean the phone looks nice and all but i dont need a paper weight i need a phone

I would have did a video review on the phone itself, but the screen would not allow me.  I have never returned anything to a seller till now.  This phone I tried so long to bare with the defects but recently, I was involved in a incident were I needed to call 911.  I had to use someone else phone just to make the phone call.  The screen would not let me, I could have opened the phone to call, but what did I pay for!  Anyway I hope its just this phone that had problems cause Im sure it is a good one.

Junk.  Charged it up and all I could get was a blank screen.  Just junk in a box.  Maybe refurbished, maybe store demo, maybe returned by someone else when it didn't work.  Box had been opened, device had been handled (lots of grubby fingerprints and smudges, and ear (?)grease or oil on screen).  Pretty disgusting.  I could have cleaned everything, but why bother when it didn't even work?Two bean cans and some string would be a better buy, and the cans wouldn't have been any more used than this device.

I really surprised. It's an excellent one. Haven't problem wiht it. Simply awesome.  I only insert my sim card and just functioning. Instead is Nicaragua.

save your money and get a real phone.  the way they designed software for LG Pathom phone is so dumb, not  user friendly at all.spend a bit more and get a better one. another thing LCD is so bad, unusable under sun light.

This is definitely a great phone, Windows 6.5, works fine, internet access is very fast, the only downside is having to buy separate SD card in my case I bought 8 GB, but the phone supports up to 16 GB, which means not enough memory to store all kinds of images and music, the price has been an excellent buy.

This was my third phone. Actually I booked two phones, one for my friend and one for myself. Mine worked perfectly fine with T-mobile sim card. In the other phone, one of the key in the keypad was not working. I decided to return the defective phone. Before returning, I just tried factory restore setting and restored the OS. To my surprise , all key worked after this restore procedure. Now both phone are working great. For low price, I would higly recommend this, although touch is not that fast in responding. Open your phone, go to Settings/System/Memory/Clear Storage has options to choose "Factory Default". Do this if you have any key not working.

es buen telefono, mas pesado que los celulares mas comunes... viene con windows mobile 6.5 version en english, no cambiable a espa&ntilde;ol desde menu... estuve buscado el rom en espa&ntilde;ol especialmente para este vs750 y no consegui nada.

El Lg Fathom es sin duda el mejor tel&eacute;fono celular que he tenido. En un principio no es f&aacute;cil acostumbrarse a el (cuesta un poco aprender a usarlo), su sistema operativo es realmente completo y es como si fuese una adaptaci&oacute;n de un windows de escritorio a un smartphone. Pero una ves que aprendes a usarlo realmente es incre&iacute;ble la experiencia. Yo le instale el Opera mobile 10 porque el explorer en este tel&eacute;fono no es tan agradable, instale tambi&eacute;n facebook, windows live, un emulador de la calculadora HP 49g, youtube, google maps, y le actualice el office mobile y todo anda perfecto. Es un smartphone que le puedes instalar lo que quieras y hacer todo lo que haces con tu netbook en este aparato. Su hardware es realmente poderoso y viene con todo el software indispensable para llevar tu oficina en la palma de la mano. Su teclado qwerty tipo slider es fant&aacute;stico y hace muy c&oacute;modo el uso de este smartphone y a la vez lo hace lucir como un  verdadero mini computador. Veo videos y escucho m&uacute;sica sin ning&uacute;n problema porque ademas tiene una entrada de 3.5mm en donde podr&aacute;s conectar cualquier aud&iacute;fono de tu preferencia con una fidelidad de audio excelente. Al principio es un poco molestoso porque si estas en la calle o tu auto se pasa buscando conexiones wifi para conectarse y a la final si estas en movimiento ya ni le haces caso pero cuando quieres conectarte a alguna red este busca con mucha eficacia donde puedas hacerlo. Su c&aacute;mara de fotos si bien no es la 7ma maravilla pero es muy decente con una resoluci&oacute;n m&aacute;xima de 2048x1536 pixeles, autofocus, grabadora de video y muchas opciones mas que la hacen mas que suficiente para las exigencias no profesionales que casi todos tenemos. Repito que este smartphone en un principio no es f&aacute;cil de usar y no es para personas que les gusta o est&aacute;n acostumbradas a tel&eacute;fonos fashion o fancy con iconos enormes para que puedan usarlo tambi&eacute;n ni&ntilde;os de preescolar, es una herramienta sumamente poderosa para tu trabajo o estudios y me atrever&iacute;a a decir que estamos ante la presencia de los &uacute;ltimos tel&eacute;fonos con un verdadero windows de sistema operativo ya que con windows phone 7, microsoft a ca&iacute;do en el mundo fancy and fashion. Realmente me doy cuenta que Lg con este producto no hace mas que mimar al publico estadounidense ya que con el precio de este mas sus incre&iacute;bles caracter&iacute;sticas lo hacen ser un verdadero regalo. Por ultimo, el idioma de este smartphone es el ingles y no se lo puede cambiar al espa&ntilde;ol u otro idioma.

I love this Phone it is very good, i am loving it. I would recommend this phone to a friend.

The phone did not work correctly from the moment we turned it on. It would not get on the T-Mobile network without difficulty.  It would not send or receive picture messages.  We returned it for a refund.  I refuse to purchase LG products in the future.  I would buy from this seller again but not LG product.  They seller ws very helpful and refunded our money promptly.

Unfortunately the seller forgot to say that the GSM is only for international and in States use is only under Verzion.  I was leaving Verzion to go to AT&T but wanted to keep my number so this phone was a no go. Had to send it back. It looked like a really nice phone though

I bought this phone a little over a year ago. I thought I was getting a decent looking phone for a reasonable price. Design is what usually catches people, but product quality is a must. This phone is slow when it comes to texting, using the internet, and shutting off. Oh and on top of that, people can not hear me when talking to them on the phone. The problem has even leaked over into my speakerphone. None of my past phones ever broke down, I just got sick of them. It sucks that I will be looking for yet another phone so soon...

The phone comes with Verizon on it. After reading some comments on the reviews, I reprogramed it T-Mobile, but it keeps coming back with Verizon. Bad Buy.

Though the phone arrived on time but, the battery was damaged beyond use and it was missing the stylus.  This phone doesn't work well without it.  When I contacted Ross Cellular about the stylus, I got the runaround and had to email them and complain.  Tey finally agreed to send the new one. The stylus and battery were sent but that battery was the wrong one and so once again the phone still did not work.  Then company went on break for Passover and they couldn't get me the correct battery.  They sent me an email saying it was on the way but then several days later after it had not arrived they finally sent it and emailed me again to say it had been sent.  Over two weeks after the phone had been ordered, the 3rd battery was on its way. That battery had signs of water damage and the phone kept turning on and off without no reason.  Needless to say the phone never worked.  I had ordered another phone at the same time and while it didn't have the sylus and battery problems the screen was not responsive to touch and would take multiple touches before it worked properly.  Also, this phone did not work properly on the Tmobile network.  When I complained to Ross Cellular they repeatedly asked me to remove my negative reviews on Amazon.  Eventullay, they told me if I would do this they would process my refund in a timely fashion and not make me pay for the return shipping.  If you want to know why there are not more negative comments about this phone and Ross Cellular it's because they bully people into taking off negative comments in exchange for handling their return smoothly. After everything was said and done I did get my refund but not without wasting weeks of time trying to make it right.  Do not buy this phone and certainly not from Ross Cellular.  Buyer beware!

S&eacute; que en muchos sitios han escrito malas cr&iacute;ticas acerca de este celular pero la verdad es que es un producto muy completo y a un precio accesible. Cierto que no tiene windows phone 7, pero tampoco tiene un windows mobile muy antig&uuml;o por lo que se pueden conseguir aplicaciones interesantes. He logrado instalar: google maps, Skype, juegos en 3D, emuladores SNES y PSX, Opera Mini, entre otras muchas aplicaciones. He actualizado el Windows Office al 2010 y est&aacute; muy completo. He podido ver presentaciones en power point y documentos word...Tiene un teclado muy c&oacute;modo para escribir y una pantalla de 3.2" que permite jugar, navegar en internet, ver videos de Youtube y muchas cosas m&aacute;s.Estoy muy contenta, funciona en cualquier pa&iacute;s porque est&aacute; desbloqueado. En fin, yo lo recomiendo y siento que el celular no merece tantas cr&iacute;ticas negativas que le han hecho.

Prompt service was excellent. The customer service was even better. I had a question I emailed it and received excellent and correct information in a timely manner. However the unlocked phone operating on a different record prevents me from utilizing all of the availabe features for this phone

I bought this phone to replace my old flip phone. This may be obvious to everyone else but this is a smartphone that requires a data plan (at least through verizon). The fact that it is a smartphone is not very clear in the product description. No complaints about the phone itself though. And I just returned the phone to amazon with no current problems

I have this phone for over 2 months now and I must say that I am more than pleased with it. You can not get a better smartphone for under $90 and that as well powered by a Qualcomm Processor of 1GHz.Display $ Appearance:=====================I only wished that the display was slightly bigger (minimum 3.5 inch) but 3.2 inch is still a very good size for a WVGA (800 x 480) display. Most of the people in the reviews have complains that the touch screen is unresponsive because due to its resistive nature but I must admit that this is the most responsive touchscreen I have ever used. The phone comes with a handy stylus that is stored at the back of the phone and is useful specially while surfing the web. You have to calibrate the screen at least once in order for it to work flawlessly. This phone is not very slim because it has a FULL QWERTY slide out keyboard which is a plus for texting and other purpose. It has dedicated buttons (physical) for Call/Cancel/Menu/Task Manager/Lock/Power/Volume etc.Multimedia Performance & Camera:===============================The default media player is not going to support all the formats out there so I installed the TCPMP which plays almost all video formats and will even stretch the display across the entire 3.2 inch screen. The video playback is very smooth and there is also a 3.5mm standard headphone jack so that you can plug in any headphone of your choice. I installed the YouTube app on it and it also plays videos really well.Camera on this phone is  3.2MP which does an okay job in taking photos in situations where you do not have a digital camera. It can also shoot videos at 640 x 480 / 25fps. The quality is not very good and somewhat acceptable if you can live with it.GPS & Other Sensors:====================This phone has built-in GPS as well as A-GPS (uses cell tower). I downloaded the Google Maps official app on it and the A-GPS was working immediately after starting the app. It was not very accurate as it will only tells you that your location lies within 30 meters or sometimes more. In order for the built-in GPS to function, you need to enable the "Location ON" from Settings>Personal>Phone>CDMA Services>GPS. If you are using the phone on a GSM network then you first have to just enable CDMA network in order to access the GPS settings because the GPS settings are only available when CDMA network is enabled. You can enable the CDMA network from settings>Personal>Phone>Network. The built-in GPS shows the most accurate position and will take about a minute or two to lock on to satellites. On average it is able to see 4-6 satellites (indoors). The maximum I was able to lock on to were 8 satellites. The more the satellites, the more accurate your position would be. If your App is unable to connect with the built-in GPS then you have to enter the GPS port, which is COM4, in the app settings. The phone also has a gravity sensor, proximity as well as luminous sensor.Windows Mobile 6.5 OS:======================The only thing that was first preventing me from buying this phone was the Windows Mobile 6.5 OS but I got over with it after I installed the app called SPB Mobile shell which makes the phone more customizable and gives you Android like menus and layout. I was also able to download some of the FREE apps from the Microsoft Marketplace. Some of the apps that I have installed on this phone are Opera Mini browser, YouTube, Google Maps, TCPMP, Facebook Mobile, SPB TV, WMWiFiRouter etc. I have kept the default firmware that came the phone and have not upgraded like others had.Things I Can Change on LG Fathom Phone:=======================================- I wish the camera was at least 5.0MP- RAM could have been 512MB, though 256MB RAM with 1GHz processor is still very fast.- Slightly bigger display (maybe 3.6")- Ability to install other OS such as Android/Windows 7 etc.- Battery life (5 hours of WiFi use is enough to drain the battery from 100% to 0%)This still is a very good phone from LG for those who have a tight budget but still want to have a smartphone. Buy it and you will not have any regrets.

es un excelente producto las funciones y la capacidad del procesador son lo mejor de todo espero no comience a fallar si se me cae por accidente.

didnt keep the phone it didnt work right.but did send money back. an i orded another phone.might orded phone again one day

Phone is fine, and no instructions are provided on how to activate it for AT&T.; Figured out eventually, after a lot of search, for voice and data. But.... Data works only on EDGE, does not work on 3G.If anyone knows how to make it work on 3G, please comment.

i have at&t and ordered this phone. the wifi was good, didn't like most of the widgets, but most important if you have a GSM network, it will not send or receive pictures and sometimes the texts do not go through!! these are important features to most the mobile community. i did like that fact that it had a physical keyboard but the phone was pretty bulky. i do not know how it would do on a verizon network, but if you have at&t i advise you NOT to order this phone!! it was nothing but a headache for me so i sent it back and then that was a headache!! Oh, i even went to verizon and at&t stores and neither would help because of the phone being verizon and the service at&t. all in all, a bad learning experience!!!

I would say this is exactly the phone I wanted. It is not Android which I seem to hate and since my wife has the Moto A855 (android) I know this phone is easier to operate. Now if your young and want to download all those apps then don't buy this phone. There are a lot of stuff you can put on this phone and it does all I need. It does receive calls a lot better than the Android and is just so smooth to operate to me. I like the slide out keyboard and touch screen. It really is nice with Windows 6.5.3 operating system. It was intended as a business phone and it does it's job well. I am an older user and like to keep it simple. Don't give up the day you buy it cause it takes a day to get used to it. The Windows stuff is so much nicer than the Blackberry and I have mine hooked up with page Plus so it is $30 a month with 1200 minutes of talk, 3000 text and 100 mb data... I love it

buenos d&iacute;as la entrega fue r&aacute;pida los felicito lo &uacute;nico es que el celular no le puedo cambiar el idioma al espa&ntilde;ol ustedes deber&iacute;an de avisar en todos sus productos que no se puede cambiar al idioma espa&ntilde;ol ya que el celular no lo puedo usar y e perdido mi dinero en ese producto de todos modo gracias.

I was so upset when i received this phone. This is the first time i had to return something on amazon. To begin with the phone weighs a ton. Also the touchscreen is unresponsive. There isn't even a way to calibrate it, the corners of the screen don't work when you try to click something on the touch screen. Also the back cover is practically locked on to the phone. it was damn near impossible to open the battery compartment. This phone is not worth the price. Don't waste your time.

I have recently left a negative review for this product but that was only because i was frustrated with getting it to unlock via sim. But i am very impressed with the phone that was sent to me even tho the volume button was jamed it was a very simple fix. I am very sorry to the seller for the very rude and un called for review as i am very happy with the product and the coustomer support that i hqve been getting. Please use this seller.

I bought this phone last week and it arrived on time with perfect packaging.It looked great, felt great, and everything was unopened and in good condition.However, upon trying to turn it on, the screen was stuck at the LG Logo screen.Of course I googled for all the solutions but none of them worked and what I came to was that it had a brick firmware and that even if I connected to the computer, it wouldn't be registered, rendering updates impossible.I'm sure it's a great phone but I cannot believe they would sell me a brick.I am very displeased. I might be a rare case, but just letting you guys know.

This Phone was amazing, it really reminded me of my old LG envy touch but this one had so much more features.

I bough it because I need to install a sales program of my company in the phones . I give the phones to the sellers and it works . perfect, good price.

I purchased this phone with the intention of using it outside of the US on a GSM network. As you can see it is clearly labelled "&uuml;nlocked". I even decided to purchase it from amazon rather than one of the other sellers that sell things through amazon(who were also cheaper)because i trusted amazon. I recieved the phone..everything looked good in terms of packaging and condition of the item however IT IS NOT UNLOCKED. It just comes with a sheet telling you how to go from cdma to gsm. Unfortunately the only way for me to really know if it were unlocked is to put my gsm sim cards in while in the country i hope to use it for. I purchased it in the US and returned to my country two days later..i was sure to ignore any verizon activation prompts. Now i have this phone capable of all this cool stuff but it's locked and really a waste of money to try to return it from here.my internet research has yielded a significant lack of unlocking ability and significant difficulty with any attempts made. Im so dissapointed.

LO COMPRE PARA USARLO EN COSTA RICA Y SOLO PUDE UTILIZARLO POR 10 MIN LUEGO DE ESO SE REINICIABA REPETIDAMENTE, TUVE QUE DEVOLVERLO A AMAZON, Y AMABLEMENTE ME REEMBOLSARON EL DINERO, PERO PERDI EL DINERO DEL ENVIO A COSTA RICA Y DEL ENVIO DEVUELTA A AMAZON... NO QUEDE SATISFECHO

Bought for my fianc&eacute; and it sucked, lost service, dropped calls, couldn't received messages sometimes and then it just started shutting down. I tried to re sell it and it goes for 13$ don't waste your money on this phone.

Great overall phone. Good quality although it is a little outdated.  Only bad thing is the outdated software, but if you're not super into having the latest software, it's a great phone to have. The touchscreen is awesome! Almost as good as an iPhone's touchscreen.  I like that it has a stylus, makes you look important when you're using it haha.  I have ATT network sim card and I put it in here and changed a few settings and works perfectly, however it won't send or receive picture texts.

Didn't last very long. My husbad used it for approximately 6 months before it became difficult. Calls were not coming through, there was a glitch in the manufacturing or something making this totally useless after about 15 to 18 months. More practical for people who do not have an active life or who can keep it totally protected from any type of damage.

OK....my wife was one of the last holdouts in the phone upgrade dept. She had been using an LG Xenon for the last 3 years. She is a major texter and not much else but I wanted to show her the benefits of a smartphone. She has little in the REQUIRED items dept, must have slide out keyboard. OK..that should be easy. Well I had a requirement as well, I'd like to eat this month so I don't want to spend $600 on a phone (BTW we are no-contract people when it comes to phone service). So I took a chance at $89 and WOW!!! I have an Iphone and to tell the truth, I prefer this to it. You will/may need to tweak it a bit out of the box for your GSM provider (texting/MMS fix readily available, small mms picture fix readily available as well) but this is an incredible phone value. I'm thinking about buying another one just to have...OUTSTANDING phone at any price.

This was the worst phone ever and I would never ever buy it even if I didn't have a phone to use.

I bought this phone directly from Amazon.com in July 2011 for my husband, so we've had about 10 months of experience with the phone. We have updated the firmware to v7 since the begining of the ownership, so the option names I mention may differ from your phone's. Without further ado, here are some of my observations.Pros- Inexpensive full-featured smartphone with touchscreen- Has a physical keyboard; good for composing longer messages- Works with AT&T; Prepaid (GSM); successfully tested voice, sms, and data (up to 3G speeds)- Works with T-Mobile (GSM); successfully tested voice and sms (I did not try data but it should be up to 2G speeds)- Should work Page Plus Cellular (Verizon MVNO, CDMA); I've been looking into this and, as long as the ESN of the phone is clean on the Verizon network, it should be fairly easy to activate- Recharges through a standard micro usb port- Simple notepad-like application (OneNote) that's easy to use- Batteries last around three days with moderate use- Many free and paid applications work on this phone if you look for Pocket PC applications- Wifi works- You can remove shortcuts in the menu that you don't want to see; so if you'll never use that Verizon app: delete!Cons- Could not get mms (picture messages) to work on GSM networks- Could not get tethering to work- Did not auto-detect the apn setting (for internet) on the sim card- Occasionally had to reboot to fix things like the internet connection (gprs) and switching between usb modes- Browser (Internet Explorer) would sometimes get an "out of memory" error from web sites- Microsoft phased out Windows Mobile 6.5 support; no more Marketplace applications- Annoyingly hard to position cursor at the beginning of a line with the stylus in the notepad application; I've have to use the direction keys on the slide-out keyboard most of the time- Ghost voicemail notification (this may be the AT&T; network's fault); icon says that there's new voicemail but actually no new ones exist- Likes to automatically delete hidden SSID network settings whenever it can't detect them- New message notification goes away even when I visit the inbox but don't read them (they're still marked as unread in the inbox)Comments- Since the phone doesn't automatically detect the apn setting on the sim card, you have to manually add it. I eventually downloaded and installed the free HTC Network Wizard .cab that automatically configures things for you based on the selected network- If you want to set up the voicemail for GSM networks, set the voicemail number to your phone's number- There's a dedicated Task Manager button on the side of the phone if you need to switch to a task or to end one- There's a physical reset button under the same flap that covers the usb port. Just use the stylus to press and hold to reboot the phone if it gets unresponsive; there's no more need to take the batteries out to do this- You have to jump through some hoops to get GPS working on the GSM side: switch to CDMA or Global (both CDMA and GSM) mode, turn GPS on, select COM4 for the port, and switch back to GSM mode; I never used it much so I can't really comment on how fast/good it is----Nov. 29, 2012 Update- This phone works with Page Plus Cellular in CDMA mode; it took the OTA programming and receives/sends calls and text just fine- It's annoying that you have to manually turn off the screen when charging the phone; otherwise, it will stay on and take a long time to fully charge

What can I say, I'm very upset for one reason. Phone works finely and has many functions. If we consider it's price phone is quite good. But again there is an important problem, at least for me.I found out that stylus is missing. I thought it maybe should not be included, but then my friend bought the same phone from amazon and there was stylus. This fact made me very angry and I'm quite unsatisfied, as I think, some parts should not be missing when I pay money for entire product, which includes many details.Seller made partly refund :) I'm not so angry any more

After seeing this phone at this price I couldnt believe it was true. It is truly a smartphone and a great one too. It comes with Windows Mobile 6.5 and it is fully customizable. It has the option to connect through WiFI or use mobile services. The major drawback of this cellphone is that it comes with its setting predetermined for Verizon. Setting it up for my company was easy. Just put in the SIM card and then go to settings (there is a review that explains how). Great cell phone.

I would have given a 5star but i had to return the phone because i bought a wrong one. But it's a beautiful phone. Good customer service. Would buy from them again.

I was needing a replacement and came across this cell phone. It was able to do what i needed and that was make calls!

this product came absolutely flawless. battery is amazing. my son lives on it...no headphones or data cable though. but those accessories are easy to get. he uses his previous blackberry accessories and with no problems. the os is very nice and the phone is quite fast on only 256mb ram. its been a few months and the phone is still in flawless condition, the screen is scratch proof! he mistreats it alot and yet it still performs. the wifi is very fast only downside he says is the camera, it lacks led flash. this phone is 3 times the amount in our country, trinidad.

Been using this phone since March of last year, and it is one of the most amazing phones out there!*** REMOVE THE VERIZON SIM CARD BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING ***1- You are not locked in with Verizon at all. I activated on PagePlus using their $29.95 plan and all works very well. The customer rep stated that there is a chance the data might not work, so I took the gamble and it works perfectly (3G)2- Download and use ActiveSync from Microsoft but your computer has to be running XP home or XP pro, and don't worry about service pack 2 or 3 because it works fine with both.3- There a major upgrade for the phone through LG (google it) and it sure spiced up the phone dramatically.4- Bought File Explorer Pro from the Market Place and now I can log-in to my home network and stream my music and a host of other tasks (Wi-Fi must be on). No other phone I know of does that!?!?5- Downloaded and installed Bing from the Market Place and now I have it all including turn by turn Navigator:)Last but not least, this phone is a powerhouse with amazing productivity tools and all handled via ActiveSync and Outlook. And if you take the time to learn about it you will be surprised how elaborate it is, and yes CityID can be stopped using File Explorer Pro and deleting the executable file...LG did a great job so let's be fair and give them all the kudos they deserve!!Enough said!

I WAS TOLD THE PHONE WAS UNLOCKED, BUT IT WAS.THE BATTERY LIFE WAS TERRIBLE! IT WOULD OVEREAT WHEN I CHARGE IT AND I WAS UNABLE TO USE THE INTERNET OR MULTIMEDIA MESSAGES(THAT MIGHT BE T-MOBILE'S FAULT).

Was probably a good phone in its day and works well on up to 3G, now-a-days the smartphone has taken its place.  Good for older generation though.

I am going to be traveling and living in Asia for the next year and I would like a phone which I can use both here in US and also in China, Viet Nam, Thailand, Malaysia.  The name of this phone is World Phone therefore it leads me to believe that it may be what I am looking for.  What do I need to do to adapt this phone for use in other countries, particularly the ones I mentioned?

The features of the phone are okey. I have the phone for 3 weeks nowbut I was not able to appreciate it as the battery is always empty.When it is fully charged it only stay up to 4 hours-standby. And I need to rre charge it again. For the past 3 days.. i dont use it anymore. I go back to theold Nokia phones that I have.One more thing, in some reviews it says that there are games like zuma de luxe &huff & puff. My unit has only "solitaire".

If you're trying to continue doing business with Windows products and use Verizon as a wireless carrier, this is the only phone I found to do it well.  I love this phone as I am not yet ready to go Google/Android products and try to do business (Google isn't ready either).  Only complaint - which is really disappointing - is the camera.  Lousy camera and no flash!?  Otherwise, great for business users.

bought this phone for my boy friend who is in Jamaica the phone works excellent with the local chip. my boyfriend absolutely love this phone, it like a mini computer in the palm of your hand, also a very great touch.

This is a gift preenet to my borther in law, the cell phone is very handy and useful. Althoough it a not smatr phone type. But the a lot of function can download and easy to control. The price is great

I so love this phone My boyfriend got me this phone for my birthday, i so love it, the pictures on the screen looks wonderful, i would recommend this phone to anyone who is on the go on a day to day basis but loves to go on the net, please note ladies that when you delete your messages you have to go to the bin and delete it from there as well :). Lets talk people isn't this phone fun

Really good product, but have some problems to configure, all is configured to run with Verizon and it in not a good thing, really "unlocked" is a word with is not totally true.MioArt.Org

Thank you very much for the price and  phone.It is phone and computer. My daughter is happy.T h a n k  y o u!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I've had this phone for a year now, and it's easily the worst I've ever owned. I'd rather go back to a Nokia flip phone from back in the day then use this slow, glitchy, unmanageable, overheating phone another minute.

This phone is awesome, but for anyone expecting the up to date, fast, easy to use and endless features, youre going to be sorely disappointed. Its a windows phone. Its out of date. and it has hardly ANY apps. you have to be a computer hacker or super nerd (nothing wrong with nerds) to reach out into the netherworld of the internet to get anything on this phone to compete with all the newer updated faster phones. Any android phone, even the lowest end ones, whip this thing's proverbial arse in anything. Hardly anything is free, and you have to plug it into a PC for most apps you would expect from today's features that are available. ALSO you cant update it. It runs like a computer, which isnt bad except it will freeze, will not automatically close out programs and will overload quite easily, for instance, you cannot run the camera when something you thought you exited out of is still in the background running. I have big fingers, so thank god for the slide out qwerty keyboard. I still havent figured out how to get ringtones outside whats already programmed. Literally, you MUST be a tech head computer whiz to get this phone, and then you must have it constantly plugged into your computer if you want anything extra, and be ready to pay. I was obviously too low tech minded for this thing and it was way out of my league. Saw a pretty alternative to the flooded market of apple products and bought the shiney go anywhere beast of a phone. If you are tech savvy, this is your phone, but i say again, you cannot upgrade it, which is a real downer, because everyone is raving about how windows 7 is so much better with so many more apps and features. sad. Also, i went to a cellphone resale site to see what i could get for it, and they quoted me at 11 bucks. its brand new, not a scratch, and ready to rock, and its 11 bucks on the market for resale. Still say this isnt a bad review, i really do wish i was smarter and could do more with it, but im just not that good. ENJOY!

I bought this phone because it was cheep and I thought it would be an awesome little smart phone... WRONG! It was awful, and kept freezing. I don't suggest buying this phone ever! The software is so out of date that the marketplace doesn't even work. Don't waste your money, or time.

Item was returned due to technical issues. I expected a lot but have send it back because troubles I had in the screen.

I got this today. It even came earlier than expected. It's fully unlocked, just AT&T users make sure your sim card is put in just right or it won't show up. The touch screen is really responsive so you don't really need the stylus. Keyboard is awesome. I've already played music with it and it sounds great. Picture quality is decent. The interface is a little overwhelming at first, but after playing around with it I actually like it. I love that it has the standard headphone jack. I think this a pretty good phone, and it was perfect for what I wanted.

i bought this phone about a little over a year ago and was fairly pleased however within the last two months the touch screen stopped working even though the phone didn't fall..it has become distressing and frustrating to use it so i basically just leave it on the shelf now.

Upgraded to V7 Rom. Mine works well with AT&T, configured the internet manually. I configured the phone to call 619-204-0806 to take me straight to my voice mail. I have over 30 apps, games and GPS. With TCPMP I play my DVDs (which I changed into PC file format). I also administer Linux servers with it (SSH). The phone does anything I want/wish. Don't need a custom ROM to customize. If you are into tweaking, this phone is great. You just need patience and time researching (Google). The phone is ultra fast. If you are planning to keep it stock, then I suggest using SPB Mobile Shell to get a super easy to use 3D look. My only complaints are that I want more battery life since I am a super power user and that I like huge phone screens. Fathom screen is ok but small compared to the EVO.

THE FEATURES THAT THIS PHONE OFFERS ARE GREAT BUT SINCE IT'S A VERIZON PHONE YOU HAVE TO GET THROUGH ALL THE VERIZON FEATURES ESPECIALLY IF YOU USE A DIFFERENT CARRIER. LIKE MY SELF I HAVE AT&T; GO PLANE AND I CAN NOT RECIEVE OR SEND OUT PICTURE MESSAGES. AND THERE IS NOTHING THAT AT&T; CAN DO OR THE PHONELG Fathom VS750 Unlocked GSM Worldphone with 3.2-Inch Touchscreen, Slideout QWERTY, 3.2MP Camera - Unlocked Phone - US Warranty - Black
