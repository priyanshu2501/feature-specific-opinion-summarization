For the Price It's the best phone that you can buy in a store "In My opinion" it's small, good signal, not heavy, easy to operate, trust me if you want a good cellphone and you don't want to pay a lot BUY IT!!

I needed a stylish basic phone to give to my mom, and that's exactly what I got. The device was in perfect condition, and it worked as expected.

I love my pebl now that the bugs are worked out.  Amazon is selling phones intended for distribution in Mexico or another Spanish speaking company.  This was confirmed by Motorola when I gave them the code of my phone.  My phone was shipped with a 100% Spanish manual and the phone turned on in Spanish.  Luckily, my SIM card switched it to English so I didn't have to hunt for the correcto Espanol button.  When I told Amazon about the mixup they could care less.  They told me to contact Motorola and gave me the wrong number.  When I complained further they gave me a link where I could download the manual.  No thanks.  I live in the US and I paid for a English hard copy manual.  Bottomline, my phone works but I no speaky spanish so I am out of luck.  Stay away.  Amazon has major issues.

Hmmm? What can I say about the phone that everyone seems to want?The Motorola PEBL phone itself, is indubitably eye-catching.  It offers exceptional operation & premium features.The PEBL is one of the most charming phones.  Shaped like a river stone, it's attired in basic black & is nicely accessorized by a shiny metal hinge. I especially liked the oval shape, the rounded edges, and the rubbery textured feel of the casing is pretty nifty. It's very compact (3.4" x 1.9" x 0.8"; 3.8 ounces), and it has weight when it's in your hand.As for features... The phone book holds 1,000 contacts, each of which can take six phone numbers, an e-mail address, a postal address, and a birth date. I like that you can place photos with contacts for caller ID that are viewed on the internal screen. Contacts can be assigned one of 12 polyphonic or MP3's. I also appreciate the camera, vibrate mode, a one-minute voice recorder, voice dialing, calculator, calendar, alarm clock, text & multimedia messaging, PC syncing (my favorite!!), instant messaging ( with Yahoo, AOL, and/or ICQ), and a Web browser.  You can personalize the PEBL with a variety of wallpapers, themes, menu styles, color skins, screensavers, and message tones. You can always download more depending on your service provider.Ok, now the bad.  The PEBL has a low-resolution camera (whaaa), and a strange magnetic flip that is awkward to open with your thumb.  The flip opens when dropped and can demagnetize credit cards.Would I buy the PEBL again? Yes.  Would I recommend it to others? Sure.  Who couldn't say 'yes' to such a looker?!!?!

I ordered the PEBL U6... It arrived quickly (1/4 star)... The battery compartment cover plate was missing from the package and the phone was obviously used or quasi-refurbished... Amazon's return and replace was quick and easy (1/4 star)...Second phone was sent next day (1/4 star)... But, again, the battery compartment cover plate was missing from the package and the phone was obviously used or quasi-refurbished... Amazon's return and refund was quick and easy (1/4 star)...The phone should be 0 stars... Amazon's service was excellent, but this phone has some serious issues from the third party.

Had the Motorola Razor and it got damaged so I decided to try this PEBL. With the Razor you can use a bluetooth ear piece and just push one button and say only the name of who you are calling. This feature I use all the time due to my hands being dirty at work. With this stupid PEBL you have to say all this junk like name dial or digit dial then finally the persons name. All these extra voice commands are not cool. The PEBL does not ever recognize what you are saying through your compatible earpiece and if it does then you are too irritated to talk to anyone. Then I dropped this phone only one time from out of a faulty case on my waist,  wow! it sure dents and scratches easy! I will not be using Motorolas any more, I think they are bad for me.

1. I will have to say first the design is very nice and small I wanted a small phone so I did like this phones size and it does look sexy2. Great screen color.3. Decent navigation through the phone4 Picture quality is average  could be a bit better my friends nokia 6101 takes better photos.5. Great phone ringer sound quality and battery is very good 2 days with use6. Speaker phone so-so the speaker is on the back so its a pain to listen and talk to at the same time.7. the keys are a little cramped have to get used to using them and they are shinny yes they get smudged all the time.8. The reception for me was average sometimes spotty cutting in and out of conversations at times.9. The other big problem was that if your keep this phone in your pocket or put pressure on the clam design the keys begin to etch themselves into the screen so you can see the outline of the keys from being in the closed position so do not put a lot of pressure on the clam when closed because over time you will see this problem.Overall I think its a decent phone but for the $250 I think it should be cheaperI paid $150 with contract upgrade dont really think it was worth that much $50-$100 would have been better

After my last phone's screen broke I wanted to get an affordable unlocked phone, although I was extremely skeptical. However I couldn't be more pleased with the PEBL. I knew I didn't want a RAZR because I don't find the shape comfortable and I think the operating system is more primitive. With the PEBL, the call quality is great, and the text messaging is not only intuitive but orders the words by your most used, so it makes texting much faster than I had found in the past. The phone is sleek and the matte texture is nice to hold in your hand. The only negative that I have found which I think has been mentioned is that the screen and keypad pick up oil from your face very easily. Overall VERY happpy with this phone!

Well when I first got it i was like ohh no what is this, but after a day or so I started really liking it. The assisted flip is really cool yet if you let someone use it warn them or theyll probly drop it. The only sound issue I had was the ringtones. Anytime you switched from silent to vibrate ring loud soft whatever it didnt matter usually after that you have to turn it off and turn it back on to ring again. The reason I upgraded was because it didnt have a memory card slot but other than that it was pretty sweet.

I order this phone NEW from amazon. I actually can't say anything about the phone itself, because I didn't get to use it at all. First of all I ordered a NEW phone and the one I received was defenitely not new. It had all the plastic sheets on it, but it was udes before. So I returned it within 5 minutes of receiving it. I am very dissappointed with  amazon. I don't think I'll order anything from them again.And the phone doesn't support the my faves plan from T-mobile. Well, just the graphics of the phone doesn't support it....so you may be able to call your faves for free, you just won't have the symbols on the screen....which is a big turn off for me.

I loved this phone.  It was the best purchase I ever made.  For four months.Now it randomly turns off (despite being fully charged) sometimes in the middle of calls.  Often, when I flip it open, the screen is crazy (cut in half or bright green or only showing part of the functions).  When it started to do this it was a lot worse, now it's mellowed out a bit (only happens a couple times a week instead of multiple times a day).Apparently this is a problem with all PEBLs, hence the discontinuation.  A woman in front of me in line at the store asked me whether or not I had the same problems with the phone blacking out as she did.  A week later mine started up.  I've also heard bad things about the RAZR too, so I don't think I'll be purchasing a Motorola phone again, despite how cute and trendy they are.I loved all the features when they worked.  I could sync up my calendar and contacts with my mac with bluetooth (altough iCal and the calendar program don't work fantastically together), and the quality of the photos is great.  Also, I really like T-Mobile, their prices and their costumer service.  They are always really polite and I can even get them to be casual with me (I'm big on customer service people not being like robots) and very helpful when I have questions.  My upgrade time is here, so I'm going to get a new phone with them.

With the unique design, seems like this could have been a really cool phone, but some of the problems I experience, make it fall short.GOODLooks damn cool and not many people have it.The automatic flip open looks cool and is convienent.  I really like this option.Fits easily in your pocket.Rubberish coating makes it easy to grip.Lazor etched keypad doesn't wear out.Uh... not much else for me!BADThe action of sliding the top down causes physical wear and tear on the phone.  I've only had the phone a few months and am not someone with the phone glued to my head; however, the metallic coating over the bottom directional button is already worn off from rubbing against the screen. The screen has a permanent imprint of the directional pad on the screen from the sliding as well as a quarter inch scratch caused my the screen sliding over the center directional button.Not sure if this is related or not to the above problem, but I'm slowly loosing the bottom of the screen. Not the physical screen itself, but the image.  It's tricky to describe but it reminds me of when you scan a picture and abruptly pull the picture from the scanner right at the end.  Right now, I've lost 2/8" inch of visibilty on the bottom of the screen.As someone else mentioned, the automatic opening works by pulling down the top with your thumb and then letting go.  Essentially, the phone pops open while it's resting on your hand.  For a moment, you are not really holding the phone at all.  More the once, the phone has popped out of my hand when opening.Impossible to read the screen in sunlight.It is difficult to read time accurately on the analog clock.  There is no option to change it to digital.Camera quality is poor.When my bluetooth headset is enabled, I cannot change the ringer or ringer volume.I cannot get the phone to send text messages.  I had the same problem with my Razor.If this where a $100 phone, no problems. But for this price... not worth it.  You're really just spending your money on the cool look and flippy thing.

Its a great phone,PROS:I like very much the mechanism to open it with one hand.CONS:The screen is much smaller than the V3 screen.

I have had the PEBL for two weeks now and it really is as slick as everyone says.  Bluetooth and very good battery life are two of the pluses.  However, as other reviewers have cited, there are flaws:- The directional button is already missing paint in a few places from the screen sliding past it when the phone is opened.  If I am seeing paint missing after only two weeks, I shudder to think what will happen after a few months.- The inside is definitely prone to getting dirty with fingerprints.- The magnets require you to keep the phone away from your credit cards as well as items such as your computer.- The first PEBL I received rang only intermittently.  Sometimes it would ring and others it woudnt do anything.  In these cases, I would only know that calls had been missed once the voice mail indicator showed.  The replacement phone I received now rings with every every call.- Connecting to the Bluetooth headset requires a sequence of six or so steps and therefore must be done before turning on your car if you are going to talk while driving.  No way can I connect the headset while paying attention to the road.  I have always used corded headsets prior to this and I find this to be annoying.- It took a few tries to get the hang of the voice commands.  I would say "name dial" and it would keep asking me to repeat the command or tell me that the command could not be found.  However, then I noticed that there is a beep after which you say the command.  As long as you wait for the beep, the voice commands work fine.- The phone opens when dropped.In summary, if you want a very cool looking, eye catching phone than the PEBL is for you.  However, if you are someone who does not care about the appearance of the phone, I would recommend looking at other models because all of the problems with the PEBL make it only about looks.

Overall Rating:  Meh...I hated it least of all available 'out of contract' unlocked choices...still do.  Will keep until I find another militaristic-looking rubber-coated beauty that works well as a phone.  (Only better...)Looks are incomparable.  If they'da lost ALL the shine, they would have been perfect.  (And it fits in your pocket too!!!)  Good to excellent call quality.  Lousy menus, maddening phone book and battery life is a joke.1.  Slick looks with a cool rubberized matte skin and a sweet spring-open feature.2.  Hard to tell from the picture, but the hinge is chrome.  REALLY SHINY CHROME.3.  The screens and keypad surface are also extremely shiny and TOTAL fingerprint magnets.  Keypad is flat with ridges, sorta slippery and not the easiest to use.4.  Menu functions are virtually incomprehensible, with stuff buried in nonsensical places.5. Phone book difficult to use, especially multiple numbers under one entry.  (My sim from a four-year-old tits-up Samsung couldn't figure out how to do it, so it gave every number a separate entry with the same name.)  I gave up after a while and simply annotated each separate name with 'cell', 'home', etc.5.  Excellent call quality.6.  Battery life as delivered was a joke--bought a brand-new battery from my provider (paying $37 to avoid the 2-year-old dud batteries so prevalent on the 'net) but the phone still must be charged nightly, or the low power alarm WILL wake you up in the middle of the night.  (And I don't talk much.)In sum:  If you want a phone that works well as a basic phone and has a slick, militaristic look that can't be beat, buy this.  If you want user-friendly software and a 'feature rich' high-tech goody-box that must be strapped to your belt, look elsewhere.(But it'll only get shinier...)NEW SPARTA

initially i fell in love with the cool flip of the phone.but this phone has a tendency of breaking (same with my friend who had the same phone, and always happen to all motorola phones with the sound anyway), and i must emphasize that i have always been very careful with my own phones.- first the sound. all in a sudden the sound is gone, and the speaker has to be used if you actually want to hear what the other person across the phone is saying.- THEN! The charging wont work. Not the charger, but the actual phone cant charge.So then my phone is literally disabled.I spent another 25 in fixing the phone.I didnt use it though, just used my other because I really couldn't be bothered with it anymore.Then later when I decided to use it again, it worked for 1 more day, then the sound wont work again. I dont even know whether I should bother fixing it again.I highly recommend you not to buy it!

I bought this phone for my wife and both of us are very pleased with it. Its cute and I personally think that its a lady's phone because of the design.

This is a good cell phone model. It has pleasing style lines, folds compactly in an attractive package, and is sharp looking in its simplicity. It always had good signal capabilities and a good battery life with good stand by and talk times. It's also fairly compact, although not the smallest of phones, and well protected from falls and such. You will see some scarring on the case texture if dropped on a harsh surface but this applies to pretty much every type of phone. It tends to be more visible on this phone's finish but I have to say I do prefer this finish to the "cold plastic" feel of other phones. One thing to watch out for is that the buttons are hard to find in the dark and/or when not looking directly at it since the tactile feedback bars are somewhat recessed into the keypad, and the screen will perpetually be somewhat greasy from your cheeks unless you're compulsively good at cleaning it after every call (Get a case or use bluetooth). Overall this is a very comfortable, sharp-looking phone with an awesome 1-handed flip out (uses magnets to stay close, so it could double as a very inefficient money clip, heh).

I love the design, and functionality of this cell phone. From the matte black, smooth clean look, to the one-hand opening procedure, to the overall streamline appearance. It has met, and exceeded all my hopes. I highly reccomend this phone for anyone who uses a flip phone. The camera pictures and videos are of superb quality, clarity, and sharpness. The software that enebles sharing of ingormation with a home computer makes this phone as useful in daily life as folks carrying around their big old Blackberry. I love it and think you will too.

The product' excelent, it's really unlocked and worked for my country, Brazil...the shipping was extremely fast.Great deal!

I have had this phone for two months now and it is the best one I have owned,I have had three razr's and many other so called cutting edge phones even the V3i and none are as good as this,as for the pebl it is simple to open unless you are a butter fingered fool,and as for the finish wearing off on the keypad well mine is just fine.The phone is made better than the flimsey Razr is,you want a quality phone that works as well as it looks get this phone,you want cheap made buy something else.

I've only had this first for about a week, but so far I LOVE IT!!!! I've had many many cell phones, a new one every 4-6 months, and so far this is my fav! I like the rubber like shell of the phone. It was alittle weird at first but play with it for 30mins and you'll love it too!

i purchased the phone two week ago and all of sudden the phone is broken. I have yet to have dropped the phone, and it did not fall in water. the screen came in already broken and i just noticed it now..never again will i order from them because i have been ordering from amazon a really long time and this is the first time something has came into me messed up..10 thumbs DOWN!

I love this phone. I love it so much when, having had it for just two weeks and accidentally immersing it in seawater so that it died, I bought another one. My original one was a free upgrade but after two weeks I was willing to spend 100 on a replacement. I liked it that much.I've now had my PEBL for over six months. I still love it, but some of its limitations have become apparent. I'll list the pros and cons and you can judge for yourself.**Pro the PEBL**It's a clamshell - why would anyone ever buy a phone that isn't a clamshell and risk phoning someone up when kicking their bag in a pub (yes, I did this with a normal phone, but fortunately phoned the friend I was in the pub with so we realised; saved a huge bill!)?Beautiful design and, as yet, I haven't found it at all flimsyThat fantastic opening manoeuvre which is just so coolSome good standard ringtonesBattery life seems fineMenus are reasonably customisable and there are lots of useful optionsThe phone is lightweight, fits in a lady's pocket and that smooth shape works wellReception seems fine wherever I use it and it's always easy to hear people and for them to hear me**Cons for the PEBL**The camera is really pants. The one on my previous Samsung was 10 times better and that was an older phone. The video feature is equally pants.Texting can be slow... you type quite far ahead of the actual phone sometimes, and I'm no speedy teenager at textingThe software that came with the phone doesn't work with my PC running WinXP (I think this is a conflict with my computer as it is meant to work); however, I have some other Bluetooth software which will work for transferring files and stuff, I just can't use all the address book features that are in the proper softwareThe main thing about this phone for me is the good design and it's very easy to live with. Despite the poor quality of photos I still give it 5 stars because I think it's that good. It won't suit everyone but that's why there are hundreds of different models of phone out there!

I've had a pebl for 2 years now and up until its unfortunate swim in a cup of french vanilla coffee- it worked like a dream.  Although the phone was years old, it remains in great shape. This is partialy due to me taking good care of it(minus occasional swims), but mainly bc of the cool texture that is virtually scratch resistant. I still have others asking me "what type of phone is that" or "is that new". The opening feature has spoiled me tremendously and I'm having a hard time finding another phone as chic and cost effective. Even after the spill in the coffee- my pebl remained true and worked fine after a few days or airing it out. It's only now (2 months later) that I see that it's time for a new phone. I think I'll stick with what I know and love and get another pebl.

Well, the shape and the style of the phone is unique I would say is one of the best desing for a phone that I'll ever seen but there the phone have big issues like memory, it only have around 8 mb of integrated memory and has no expansion slots on top of this integrated camera is VGA so your photos will have a low resolution and quality, so pretty much is a phone that do his work call and receive calls, with a great desing but right now isnt one of the best around.Gave it 4 of 5 stars because it acomplished his duty

Motorola was floundering in the cell phone market until they came out with the RAZR.  Worldwide, it made a fashion and technological statement, which catapulted the manufacturer from a dismal afterthought to a leader in the cell phone market.  Then they released a candy bar equivalent (SLVR), and then improved on the RAZR's lines with the stylish clamshell PEBL.  This review is for the Motorola PEBL.After using the PEBL for a few days, the first thing that impressed me was the sound quality.  Recently, I have played with Sony/Ericson, PalmOne, Nokia and Samsung phones, and must say the Motorola sounds best.  First of all, the volume in the earpiece is loud enough for me to hear while walking on a busy New York city street, with cars, trucks and buses all creating a deafening noise.  Second, the volume control button is well placed to allow you to easily adjust the level.  Third, and best of all, the phone is intelligent enough to filter out much of the loud background noise, so that the person you're speaking with can hear you without struggling to make out what you're saying.  I have found that Nokia is good at this too, while Palm, Samsung and Sony/Ericson phones don't do this well at all, with Sony ironically at the back of the pack.  Also noteworthy is the speakerphone.  While it's not as loud as an office phone's speaker, it is plenty loud, for example,  to participate in a conference call while driving.  And with the background noise reduction virtues of this phone, I was impressed.  Also, it has voice recognition - based solely on the spelling of your contacts, the phone will recognize what you're saying and be able to voice-dial.It may seem odd to make such a fuss over sound quality in an age of smart phones, but as a designer recently explained to me: form should follow function.  So let the PEBL first and foremost be a good phone.  Then you can add the bells and whistles later.  Attention to this principle is what earned the PEBL five stars from me.A note about carriers: GSM is worldwide, so you can use your phone overseas as well as in the USA.  However, this limits you in the states to Tmobile and Cingular.  Having used both, I feel that Tmobile sounds better, but Cingular has better coverage.  It's a tradeoff.  Both carriers offer a 7 or 14 day "trial" period during which you can test the network's performance.  I recommend use that trial, and don't hesitate to bounce back and forth while keeping your number.I have four major pros for the PEBL:1. Motorola is pioneering the cell phone market by making all of their latest models "quad-band" GSM, which means the phone will work well in the USA (850/1900 Mhz) as well as the rest of the world (900/1800 Mhz).  Most GSM phones are Tri-Band (850/1800/1900) so while they'll work great here, but performance abroad will be touch and go, with the phone performing poorly indoors.  None of the others (Nokia, Ericson,  Samsung etc.) offer quad-band GSM as a standard, and until Motorola's recent offerings, you could only find Quad-Band phones in massive PDA smart phones.2. Battery life: All cell phones give estimates in standby time and talk time. But the realistic factor is how long will this thing last between charges for the average person?  My answer: 3 to 4 days.  With moderate use (about 10 calls a day, totaling between 30 and 45 minutes), I needed to charge the phone after the 3rd day.3. USB port: the phone's connection to the world is via a standard mini-USB port.  The charger fits this, or you can plug it into your computer with a standard USB to mini-USB cable.  This is the same cable that connects most digital cameras or certain mp3 players (at least the ones that don't use overpriced proprietary cables).  Chances are you already have one of these cables and if you plug it into your PC, two things will happen: the phone will start to charge from the USB, and the PC will detect a new device.  Download the drivers from Motorola (if you didn't get the CD with your phone).  In addition to phone drivers, there is a "Phone Tools" application that lets you to synchronize your contact list and calendar with Outlook, or you can simply backup the phone's contents.  You can synchronize your photos, ringtones and SMS messages as well.  Here's the best part: the phone is also a modem.  Make sure you have a data plan before connecting to the internet, and you no longer need a hot spot.  GPRS will give you a little more than 2x the speed of dialup, EDGE will take it up to about 4x.4. The phone has an alarm built in.  In fact it has several, and you can name them, and if you turn the phone off at night, the alarm will still work, and ask you if you want to turn the phone on when you silence it.Other noteworthy items: the screen is good, the camera produces reasonable images and videos, and there is enough memory to snap over 100 shots at the phone's highest resolution.  That is a nice touch.And now, three Cons:1. For the longest time, I have not cared much for the Motorola contact management interface.  Nearly all phones now allow you to have multiple numbers / addresses per contact, but Motorola hasn't caught on yet.  If you have a contact with multiple phone numbers, that contact will exist multiple times.  This makes dialing slower with Motorola phones because you'll have to scroll through a longer contact list; searching for numbers is not nearly as intuitive as with Nokia or other phone brands.2. The phone allows you to assign custom ring tones for certain members of the address book; however, for contacts with a custom ringtone, the phone doesn't differentiate between calls and text messages, so if a contact with a custom tone sends a text, the phone might play an entire minute-long song rather than a quick beep beep, which can be annoying in the middle of the night.  Just avoid using custom contact/ring tone assignments and you'll avoid that problem.3. The shiny dialing surface and screen will pick up grease from your face and require regular cleaning if you want to avoid your phone looking "icky".In conclusion, I was happily surprised with the PEBL.  It is a very sexy phone, and it sounds great.  It is the perfect phone for the audiophile, or for a person who wants a device that just works without having to cope with all the secondary bells and whistles phones have these days.  Historically, Motorola was known for producing good hardware - a virtue that is clearly stated with the PEBL.  If you intend to use all the fancy features of modern cell phones (SMS, MMS, etc) - in other words if you plan to use the software features, expect them to be less intuitive than with other brands of phones.  As much as Motorola is known for producing excellent hardware, their menus and navigation can be bewildering at times.  I think they should get the folks who designed the hardware to redesign the software interface.  Then, the Moto range would dominate.  In the end, it's a good phone, it's solid, it's small and light enough to fit in comfortablty your pocket, and above all it works.

It is pretty cool but it does not have enough memory, so its hard to get music on.

why would you buy this for $194 when you can buy a brand new one from Motorola for $139?

I am on my fourth Pebl within a year. It seems it either can not take the use or does not liked to be unlocked. I use the phone everyday text/Im/email very often. The picture/voice/video messaging jams when sending so you never know if the other person receives it, and to delete the phone has to be turned off/on. The battery life does not last a full day, thats without talking. The pebl has a good look and the clam shell opening is great. The keyboard is nice, except it always want abort my messages when I type to fast.

I ordered this product from Amazon directly (not from a third party, although it appears amazon doesn't sell it anymore), and while they sent me a new, functional, phone like I had ordered, it is not the US version.  The first hint was that when I opened the box the charger was the continental Europe-style charger (two round prongs).  The second hint was that the spellings of some of the menus are in the Queens english ("Personalise" for example).  The phone is working fine with my US provider's SIM card (Cingular) and they did include an adapter for the charger, but it sticks out of the wall almost 5 inches now as a result.  4 Stars for the phone, but 2 for Amazon for not making it clear what I was getting.

I purchased this phone to use in Europe during a recent trip. I loved it. Very nice form factor, opening it requires only one hand and voice quality was great. Very happy with the purchase. I wish my US carrier (Verizon) had the same phone!

Thank you very much for the phone, it's in a perfect condition, and the one-touch flip is very cool.

I love the phone! Its super sexy, easy to use, all i wanted. I am in love.

I purchased years ago when unlocked phones were not easy to buy.Great purchase, used in Brazil while visiting my family.Any place chips can be found.I would recommend 4 bands so it can be used all over the world.

This has to be the absolute worst phone in the world.  Menus suck, reception is lousy, it has problems with bluetooth signal quality and is constantly telling me to switch to the handset, the battery life is good for about an hour or two at most of talking, the keypad is hard to use because the directional pad has an awkward shape.  I go this phone for free and hate it!  I will glady pay money to get a phone that I feel is functional.  The only good thing about it is the fact that it has a nice one handed opening mechanism.  Thats it.  There is nothing else worthy of even mentioning of this unfortunate waste of plastic.

I have used the PEBL for a year now and I bought this one to replace my damaged one. The one I received works but if I knew it was  REFURBISHED one (which is not indicated anywhere) I would not have paid so much for it. A refurbished phone is not worth $170.

No issues.  Performs as expected.  Easy to use and small enough to carry in my pocket.

This phone is a delight to hold and a pleasure to feel. It's unusual shape makes it stand out from other phones. Very STYLISH !But, has very limited in built memory of 5 MB which can not be extended. Camera quality is not much to talk about. It weighs much more than Razr V3.It takes some time to get used to the flip mechanism and there is a real danger of phone falling off your hand  when you try it for the first few times.

This phone is great and durable.  Has every feature that the razor has but won't break if you drop it.  The automatic flip open feature is great as well.  I recommend both this phone and the seller.

i got this phone because it looked nice and it does.  but in terms of functionality and usability it is at the bottom of the list.  motorola interface is very counter intuitive and it took a bloody long time to send one text message out.  to top it off the pairing of bluetooth devices didn't work autmoatically.  everytime i wanted to connect to my toyota prius i had to press about 6 buttons.  i got tired of this and ended up selling my pebl.  if you want a real phone get a k800i by sony.

I purchased this phone primarily as a travel phone to europe and the caribean and it hasnt faied me. It has very good reception,easy to remove sim card and its small so that you can silde it in your pocket and not even know its there. It doesnt have all the bells and whistles of a modern unlocked phone to be used in the usa. However if you are a traveler like myself, it is very reliable for gsm networks. The only downside is that you cant store multiple phone numbers under one name but rather have to list the same person over and over if you want to enter home,cell,bus number etc...The screen is all black so it tends to get messy with facial oil stains but big deal....The phone is slick and reliable....best for out of the usa use.....I strongly recommend it.

I'm only wasting time on this review, because I felt like I had to. The cell looks great, but it doesn't works like it looks. The keypad marks on the screen as soon as you are in hot areas. The faceplate has awful quality and has bad signal.

I recently bought this phone in preparation for some travel abroad.  I'm now using it in Brazil, and have had no problems with it.  It's compact, durable, and easy to use.  I particularly like the magnetic closing action that makes it easy to open, close, and use one-handed.

I purchased this unlocked PEBL phone for my daughter to use while she was studying in Greece, so once there she could buy a Greek SIM card, with a Greek phone number, and avoid roaming charges from using her US iPhone.  She was still in the US when it arrived, and the PEBL came with an international charger and manuals, but did not come with a SIM card.  This phone needed an inserted SIM card before it would allow her access to any setup menus, or to try it out to make calls, so she used the SIM card from her iPhone temporarily and it worked fine.  She was easily able to bluetooth sync the PEBL to her MacBook and transfer her contacts list using iSync, and to make calls on the ATT network.  Once she was in Greece, the phone has worked great with a Greek SIM card.

Phone arrived DOA, after company sent 2 replacement batteries phone still did not work.  Sent replacement phone, worked for the first charge and now it's dead.  If you plan on wearing the phone on a belt phone case, the phone will flip open on its own.

It didn't take me very long to pick out this phone from the lineup at the store; it just looks and feels totally differnt from all of the other phones.  Yes, I love all of the features, but really, I love how it feels.  My previous phones feel so cheap now compared to this.  It's solid; it firmly flips up and confidently closes with a snap.  The black, exterior coating is unlike anything I have ever felt before.  It reminds me of a rubber coating, but is much more solid, as it turns out, the coating is actually paint.  Imaging a cross between a rubber coating and a car finish.

I just got the PEBL and I love it. I had been waiting for its release for several months and it was well worth it. Many of the ticky-tack features that I didn't like in the Motorola RAZR have been corrected here. While not as thin as a RAZR, the PEBL is lightweight. The black cover has a rubberized feel and the oval shape means that it sits comfortably in your hand. The hinged mechanism to open the phone is great - and one of its most distinctive features: One flick of the thumb and the phone gently flips open. The sound quality is great, from video clips to HiFi ringers to speaker phone. It's loud and clear. The camera and video features are decent. Overall, it operates like any other Motorola - the menus are standard. If it bugged you that the Call and End buttons were flipped right to left in the T722 models, Motorola has returned to its senses and placed the Call button on the left and end on the right side. As for fingerprints, they do show up on the cover and key face. The PEBL is still no v60, but it comes pretty close. If nothing else, it definitely has the Wow factor.

this phone is very good, great desing, the camera take pictures very clear, if only has a expantion port for increase the memory it will be the best

I've had this phone for about a year now, and it's not only the worst phone I've ever owned, it's the worst phone I've ever heard about. Physically it's not bad - it's a decent size, has a nice display and an external LCD. However the battery is very prone to slipping lose from the internal contacts causing the phone to turn off randomly; simply putting it in the pocket of a pair of jeans can be enough to dislodge the battery.It barely works *as a phone*. I have yet to find a spot where the signal is strong enough that it won't cut off, even when it has all bars maxed out. The microphone has lousy gain, unless you happen to be in an area with a slight breeze and then it picks the wind noises to the exclusion of all else. I've had so many calls where the person kept telling me the wind was too loud, and there was just barely a breeze!Taking a picture is easy, but then the phone forces you to decide how you want to "store" the picture by making at least two selections from the menu! This is completely ridiculous...how about I take the picture and it just stores it immediately without me doing anything?The phone just acts very weird. Whenever I check my voice mail, and even sometimes just at random, the phone recieves an undecipherable text message with no return address. Read three voicemails, you get three messages. No reason for it, it just happens. Even worse - I've had voicemails that it didn't inform me about for *over a week*! It's very common for it to not inform you about a voicemail for a couple of days. I have yet for it to let me know about a voicemail within a few minutes or even hours of receiving it.If you don't keep this phone fully charged, it will beep nonstop about every three minutes until the battery is really and truly dead. More than once I've had to get up at 3:00 AM to turn the damn thing off. Finally I located the notification options, there are about 20 of them, I turned them all off except the only one that a phone should have - the incoming call ring.Forgot your cell phone number? No problem, it's so easy to just look it up on the phone itself, right? Well, not on this phone - it's buried about five menu levels deep. I finally made the phone wallpaper the phone number so I could see it right away.I can't wait for my service contract to end so I crush this phone with a hammer.

The PEBL does have a nice hand feel, the opening mechanism is well thought out and works well in Europe but the "good" ends there. I have used the PEBL for over a year and have had 5 or 6 mobile phones prior to this one. I use it for work which takes me overseas a fair bit.The Motorola contact management interface is cumbersome to deal with. Most phones allow you to have multiple numbers / addresses per contact, but PEBL does not. If you have a contact with multiple phone numbers, that contact will exist multiple times. This makes dialing slower with Motorola phones because you'll have to scroll through a longer contact list; searching for numbers is not nearly as intuitive as with phones.The "mirror" dialing pad and screen will pick up grease from your face and require regular cleaning if you want to avoid your phone looking oily. And the dial pad begins to show up on the screen in a shadow pattern after a while. A brilliant design weakness.Connecting to the Bluetooth headset requires a multi-step sequence.The voice commands are cumbersome. As another reviewer noted "I would say "name dial" and it would keep asking me to repeat the command or tell me that the command could not be found." After some time I noticed that there is a beep after which you say the command. As long as you wait for the beep, the voice commands better - not perfect, but tolerable if you don't mind repeating yourself.The phone opens when dropped, which is often since a decent belt holder is hard to find for this model without buying a leather sleeve which sort of defeats the nice palm feel the PEBL has. And now when it drops it not only opens but the back falls off and the battery spills out.Photo taking is frustrating. Easy to shoot the photo, but then the phone forces you to decide how you want to "store" the picture by making at least two selections from the menu! This is obnoxious.  I would like to just take the photo and have the phone store it without me performing several selectionsMaybe it is my cell carrier, but I've had voicemails that it didn't inform me about for several days and sometime up to a week! Like another reviewer, I have yet for it to let me know about a voicemail within a few minutes or even hours of receiving it.Also annoying is the fact that it will beep nonstop every 3 to 5 minutes when the battery is getting low about until the battery is really and truly dead. I've had to get up at 3:00 AM to turn the damn thing off. There are notification options buried deep in the directory that will turn this "feature" off.

I hate this phone!  I have had it replaced 3x because it has broken down.  My srceen went out, there was a constant eco, and the sound went completely out.  I have only had the phone for one year.  Camera clearity is poor, and I used to like the way it opens but now its just anoying.Its cute but thats it.

I bought this unlocked cell phone (though I got the teal version) the last time I was in the US, for use for me in China.It has been a dream for me to use.  The Bluetooth features have been a little more friendly to use than on my previous (locked) RAZR v3.  The pictures the phone takes often look pretty reasonable.  The opening/closing mechanisms work well, with no signs of damage in the month I've used the phone.  I would say that my only complaint is that I don't yet understand the voice commands yet.So, I would recommend the use of this phone, easily!
