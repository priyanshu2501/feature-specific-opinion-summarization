I'm glad blu is out there to battle with the big dogs.  My best friend wanted and still wants to trade me his S4 straight even.Dual sim and save everything to a 64 micro=lightning  I have straight talk and att service.  I couldn't be happier.  I work on the road and use my phone in a dif state every few weeks. As of yet I have no choice but to give it a perfect score! ***** 100  *****  and to the people who says it feels like its going to break and this and that is to thin.  Waahhh!!  It is super thin and its awesome slides in n out of any pocket.  I'm getting another blu  very soon.  Ty blu

I WENT TO CHARGE MY PHONE AND IT JUST KEPT DRAINING THE BATTERY, TO MAKE A LONG STORY SHORT ITS BROKEN AT THE CONNECTOR -JUST LIKE ANOTHER BUYER HAS WROTE IN THEIR REVIEW.Well taken care of in the last 2 weeks and now its nonworking.I can get it to charge exactly like the last person who had this wrong by having the device low and plug in and cable higher making it connect.  So another review gone sour.Have used many diffrent brands of Android phones in the past and this measures up to the best of the name brands and their so called Flagships.Memory card to expand max of 32gig with a total max of 36 gigabites in the phone.Phone has Jelly Bean which is the newest operating system of android and updates and has no BLOATWEAR. I repeat no programs that are unwanted and slow down the system like all other carrier branded.This phone also offers bluetooth 4 which is the newest!!The phone can be Rooted but do not know if that term of service by doing so. The phone can also play Netflix,huluplus,crackle and other streaming services and can connect easily to windows operating systems for transfer of songs,shows,pictures,documents.Just alittle info that I didnt read on other reviews.

In reading some reviews, I was temped to not order this phone. I was looking for a modest replacement/upgrade for my a Samsung Infuse 4g, and this phone met my price point, but seemed to be taking a beating on some reviews. Hands down, this phone is a winner, blending solid hardware, a near stock Android experience, all day battery life, smart features, and a lot more performance than I had expected.Is it a performance powerhouse? No. But it works wonderfully. True, a little more memory would be nice, and I will certainly upgrade my microSD card for the extra storage, and with a higher speed class card.My only recommendation for people looking at this phone, buy it, it won't disappoint!

Luv it! :)Bought more 2I dindt expect to much but it really over my expectation. Was realy good. Talking good to all my parents. :)

I bought this for my dad, real top end features, light, amoled screen, fast, good quality and nice look!!! fully recommended!

Great product, I just hope they make a quad band 3G or 4G version soon. It is definitely comparable to the S3 and S4, for waaaay less

Great phone that feels like a high range model of other brands at a cheap price and the best thing, Stock JB 4.2. Works fine HSPA+ with Movistar Venezuela. Coming from a slow galaxy ace, this's a huge change.

Phone has a terrible display. There were air bubbles on the screen that I had no way to get of (The have some kind of plastic screen on the display). This phone was repacked and sent back within 10 minutes of receiving it.

just got this phone and let me tell you its awesome.for the price its unreal.i use straight talk and this phone is rated as good and compared to the samsung galaxt s4. price is awesome.

I really like the feel, look and operation of the Life Play. The lightweight and thin size of the phone makes it great to hold. Though the higher end phones may have better operating features the Life Play has very good operating features for the price. The 1.2 GHz dual core processor is very fluid. I have experienced no problems after two months. The camera is good, though not great. The biggest drawback is that the phone does not support Adobe Flash. Overall I am very satisfied with the Life Play and very much enjoy using it. I use the phone on Unlimited Net10 no contract.  The signal is great and clear especially compared to my former Sprint service.

I bought this phone for my wife and shes inlove with it! She says its so pretty and does everything she needs it to do.

This blu life play phone is amazing. Getting 7mbs on simple mobile network on the regular. The max was 10mbs. The phone is light and powerful at the same time great deal for 200 buck cant lose

it is excellent phone, good cpu 1,2 Ghz quad core, brigth screen 4,7&#34;, take excellent pictures 8 megapixel camera back, ligth.

It is nice but I just wish it had more bells and wistles.  Like swipe text, better camera, and talk instructions.  over all nice.

this cellphone is excellent, i have it 3 days ago and Works excellent and is so fast too, it Works in 3g here in Venezuela, it a great phonne 100% recomended

I shopped around for my first Android phone. I was leaving Blackberry after many years, but I was eager to get the functionality of my Nexus 7 in a phone size without paying too much.I picked this phone because it's a US company (though handsets are made abroad) and because it has 1 GB of RAM (more than other similar budget phones) and because it is set up to run apps from the SD card. I have not been disappointed.The other selling point was the dual SIM, though one is micro and one is standard size. My regular T-Mobile SIM worked fine in the second slot. But now I have my UK SIM in that second slot as I was able to change my T-Mobile SIM to a micro.Battery life is decent. It may need a boost in the afternoon when I have the screen up a lot. But when it's just at the ready as a phone, it holds the charge well in standby.I a semi-pro photographer, and I'm happy with the 8 megapixel camera. It's a nice upgrade from my Blackberry Curve. The CNet review pointed out that the camera doesn't do macro well. They're right that you can't get too close to focus. However, 8 MP gives you a lot of room to digitally zoom or crop after the fact.There was no bloatware installed. I did replace a few stock apps, but that all amounts to personal preference. The Android installation is almost as stock as the one on my Nexus 7. The biggest additions are the interface to set up your two SIMs and move apps to the SD card. (There is an icon for SIM Toolkit. Don't use it. Go in through settings instead.)There isn't an LED light for notifications. It's one of the corners cut, but I hardly miss it. I do miss having a camera-specific key, but it's not a big loss.The 2 MP front camera has a wide angle lens for selfie-group shots. 2MP is more than enough for sharing online and even making a small print.I don't game, so I can't speak to that. But the phone runs Netflix well.And, yes, it works as a phone. I haven't had problems with sound quality nor dropped calls.

Let me make myself clear: initially, this phone is fantastic.  The screen is big and easy to read; I had no issues with any sensitivity on the phone, and the phone itself came with a ton of accessories (phone case, charger, wall charger, headphones, etc).  However, the appearance of the phone does not excuse the quality of the hardware's performance.  I got my phone in November, shortly before Thanksgiving, and by Christmas, it had stopped charging unless I positioned the charger a certain way. (I was NEVER rough with my phone.) By the end of January, it had stopped charging altogether. Because it comes with a warranty, I was able to send it in. I sent it through express mail on the 11th of February and only just today, March 28th, received it back - thanks, I'm sure, to the fact that I sent an aggravated e-mail. The customer service is downright awful.  There was no communication whatsoever on the status of my phone and, even when they finally e-mailed me back on the 20th to ask me if they could replace my phone (it took a MONTH for them to decide they were going to replace it, by the way - a month!), they didn't answer me back until I sent an e-mail a week after asking if they were going to replace it or not.  I've just received my replacement and not only is the phone dirty - the screen has smudges and fingerprints all over it, and the case it literally caked with grime - but there are dents and nicks all over it. Seriously? I cannot be more disappointed with BLU than I am right now, especially since the phone seemed so promising.

I got this phone in August and I have loved it since day one. I am a former iPhone user so I was nervous about android but I will never get another phone. I bought it for the camera and sound quality and it did not disappoint. I have had no charging issues at all. My only small complaint is taking a night photo with flash doesn't turn out to great but it is a nighttime photo so I can't complain. It took me awhile to figure out screen shots(power/volume down together) other than that absolutely perfect!

Out of the box, this phone looks great. It has a very nice display, and runs Android 4.2. Also, it supports 2 SIM cards, and you can configure the SIMs such that one or the other is the default for voice, data, SMS, MMS. As a Pay As You Go user, I was excited to mix and match phone service providers to get the best and lowest cost voice and data coverage.The first problem I had with this phone, was its inability to run the Audible App. Audible would just hang when a title was selected for play. Eventually an error dialog would appear asking to send a bug report / terminate the program. After emails with Audible and Blu Products, Audible announced a new release, that seems to have corrected the problem. All well and good, but my confidence was somewhat shaken with this product.The thing that made the phone not acceptable, however, was its habit of locking up in standby about once per day. At some random time during the day, the phone would refuse to come out of standby. When its number was called it would not ring, and the caller would hear a "User is not in the service area" message. The only way out was to pop out the battery, re-insert it, and power up the phone. This is never convenient. After two weeks of this, I gave up and sent the phone back.I have no idea if this was a defect in the phone itself, or some software problem. But it was enough to make me give up. It certainly would have been a good value for the money otherwise.

About 15 months ago my Samsung Galaxy died, so I upgraded my 2 year contract with AT&T; for what was at the time one of the lastest and greatest phones out the Motorola Atrix 2. I don't have to tell you how many new phones have come out since then and how much the technology has advanced in such a short period of time, but AT&T; wouldn't let me upgrade my phone until March 2013 (this was before their new phone financing program became available in August 2013). My Atrix 2 was crashing daily and I needed a new phone NOW but I didn't want to pay $600 for a new unlocked brand name phone...what to do??Well...while browsing on Amazon I learned abou the Blu Life Play phones. Can this be real?...I asked myself. So after reading all of the positive reviews, I decided to pull the trigger. I work in sales for a web development company, but ironically I don't really need the latest and greatest technology to get through a typical day at work. I need a reliable phone that will allow me fast access to email, chat, GPS functions, a web browser on occasion and of course a phone that doesn't lock up everytime I receive a call while multitasking. This phone does all of that very well...and more!One thing you should be aware of (and this really shouldn't be viewed negatively because afterall it is an unlocked phone) is that you'll need to set the APN settings in order for the network wireless Internet to work. The manual that comes with the phone doesn't tell you this, and you might think that there is something wrong with the phone when there isn't. The APN settings can vary depending on your carrier and type of service plan that you have, but I've found that the following settings provide the fastest through put for AT&T; 3G HSPA+.Here's how to set up AT&T; 3G/4G APN settings manually for Android smartphones, this will work on all unlocked international Android smartphones.System Settings-->Mobile Networks-->Access Point Names-->(Create New APN)Name: AT&T; HSPA+APN: phoneProxy: leave blankPort: leave blankUsername: leave blankPassword: leave blankServer: leave blankMMSC: [...]MMS Proxy: proxy.mobile.att.netMMS Port: 80MCC:310MNC:410APN Type: defaultBe sure to save the settings and then select the profile that you just created and reboot the phone. You can download the Speed Test app to test out your Internet speeds.

Love it!!! I can't say anything bad about it! I purchased other unlocked phones and had nothing but trouble. BLU you rock!!!

I've owned this phone for about 6 weeks.  I have it activated on Ultra-mobile.  Activation process was pretty painless - Ultra does require some configurations to use SMS, but was pretty easy to do with their generic android instructions.I'm a fan of Android.  The life play has a recent version, and works as expected.  All apps have worked fine.  This phone replaced a Kyocera Event I used with Virgin, which is a cheap phone that crashed a lot with processor intensive apps or multi-tasking, but was serviceable.  This Life Play is a big step up in screen size and processing.  I've not had any lag issues or over-tasking type of behavior.  There has been about 2 or 3 times where the phone has locked up and I had to pull the battery to re-boot, but I'm not sure that wasn't caused by an app.  It hasn't happend enough that I'm worried about it.  I haven't tried any 3D gaming, but it'll run youtube/hulu/netflix perfectly (on wifi), and I can play Angry Birds Star Wars while listening to podcasts with podkicker simultaneously without any lag - which was near impossible on my Virgin phone.I haven't had any high level android phones to compare this one too, but my wife has an iPhone 5.  The Life Play has a bigger screen and is thinner.  My hardware feels equal or better, but the Apple software is probably better/smoother, such as her voice commands with Siri are better interpreted than mine seem to be with Google.  But this is more of an Apple vs Google issue that I don't think matters here.GPS has worked fine with Nike running app and google maps.  However, there was one very foggy day when I couldn't get a signal, and my wife's iPhone did, so I guess head-to-head with a "premium" phone I'd have to say it failed, but it was extreme conditions.  It's worked most every other time just fine.I use regular headphones to listen to music (no microphone).  The sound quality has been great, I have had no issue with headphones.  Speakerphone has worked as expected as well.  No sound/speaker issues for me.  Bluetooth has connected to my stereo adapter and laptop without issue as well.Battery lasts a full day with "regular" use.  Less with a lot of screen time, and more if you are just on stand-by.No accessories available that I find, but it does come with a basic silicone cover, which is nice.Call quality is good.  Probably depends on your carrier, but it's fine for me on Ultra (ATT network).PROS:  Big screen.  Plenty of processing for an average user.  Feels like a more expensive phone.CONS:  no accessories, off-brandI'd recommend if you are looking for an upgraded, unlocked Android for moderate price.--------------Update, 16 July 2014 - The phone has become unusable as it will no longer charge.  This has apparently happened with several other units.  I've been happy with the phone up to this point.  Only other issue has been that the GPS has not been very accurate.  If I am not moving the direction arrow is erratic, and when I am moving, it places me several feet off of the street I am on, often on adjacent streets.  It works well enough that I can find my way, but I have to be aware when it places my location on a close but wrong street.  Due to these issues I would no longer recommend this particular model, but I'd probably get another cheaper BLU phone.

IT IS MY NEW PHONE, IS AMAZING. I THINK THAT THE PRIZE IS EXCELENT AND MY WIFE IS GOTTA BUY ANOTHER FOR HER

This phone seems to function fully but I have to restart. When I tried to check my voice mail, somehow it connects to my own phone. Often it is disconnected from Skype or Outlook...I am wondering this is within the range of normal function or my phone is defective...my data should be 3G but it is very slow to download pics...don't recommmend this phone.

The phones perfect works flawlessly perfect weight size perfect screen for the money its your best bet so buy it already

Great product especially for the price.Cons: Battery life isn't fantastic but you should get threw the day with moderate use the flash isn't great but I don't take pics at night that much so doesn't prove to be a problem. Operating system is very basic although I prefer it that way.Pros: The price is super cheap.  Super snappy in transitions the CPU is great as is but I will probably change he timing by that's just me. The screen is awesome and the options for the background are great. All together an awesome phone flash is really bright so its great as a flash flight camera is awesome most are fooled by megapixels when in reality you have to look at the camera processor and this phones camera is pretty impressive for a phone. Couldn't be happier get it get it get it.

This phone is great for the price. It solved my need to have dual sim card phone for a low price. Looks good, very light weight. The camera works well for everyday leisure use.  Although the back cover is flimsy, the gel cover that comes with it, is perfect for correcting this issue and protecting the device. Set up was easy, although the user manual is very light on details or specifications and most of the info i had to search for online. The bad: by far the worst part of this phone is the battery life. If you use this phone all day, you will need to charge it every 6 hours or so. I tried different battery saving settings and even installed a battery saving app and i'm still having to recharge it some time around mid afternoon. I charge it every night and turn the power off at night. Turn it on around 7am. I use it for work but i am hardly on the phone. Most of my usage is for sending and receiving email and txt.

this phones radios don't seem to work right! on auto gsm wcdma it'll get stuck on edge... when it gets stuck it doesn't go back to 3g or hspa without manually registering it on the t- mobile network! I even called T-Mobile and manually put in the apn settings and no dice! it lags a little bit on transitions too. just a little tho! aside form that it's a pretty good phone!

Best Value for an Android phone while stilll having great specs at the same time and a more up to date OS version than other manufactures at this price point. Phone also feels very unique as am asked what type of phone is that all the time due to the bright gorgeous yellow which looks better in person than in pictures

I've had this phone for about a week and a few days.Pros:The phone is fast, light weight and works perfect with my Straight Talk Sim card.  The screen is crisp and clear and the camera is awesome. No problems with any apps that I use on the regular at all.  My speeds for browsing are super fast and uploading pics and vids to my drive are seamless.  Coming from a Samsung Galaxy Note 1 this was a major upgrade.Cons:My phone came with one dead pixel in the top right corner which makes watching movies or videos a bit annoying. The second problem is that the charger stopped working last night.  I tried multiply plugs in the house and the charger just doesn't work. Thank goodness I have a laptop.

Its a great phone! Your not bound to expensive contracts or networking zones. I can basally take this phone with me wherever I travel Europe, Australia, even South America. The duel SIM is very convenient--and the Android OS is up-to-date! Wifi and Bluetooth are included--will purchase again! Hands down!

Phone working good for seven months.Pros:- Perfect size in your palm, is very thin and light.- 4.7 screen displays Brigth colors.- Screen resolution 720x1280 ideal for reading, videos and even games (similar phones more expensive lack that pixel density)- Battery can be removed/replaced, 1800mA good for a busy day, I recommend download "Battery Doctor" app for optimize and detect battery draining apps and extend battery life, and also Clean Master for delete not useful temporary files and clean memory.- Supports for Dual SIM, Mini and Micro, when both are installed you will able to select SIM preferences by default for: SMS, Data and Calls, or decide each time. Veru useful, Personal SIM and Job's SIM in the same phone, or travelers can have a local SIM and data plans in visited country.- Unlocked, no contracts- Good speaker for listen songs in a small room- Radio FM (needs wired headphones as antenna)- Includes case for basic protection and also screen protector- MicroSD support until 32GB- Modern Android 4.2 (at this time 2013)- Quad-core processor- Front camera, most used for video callsCons:- No LTE (supports 2G,3G)- No Led for flash alerts of new messages, missing calls, connection status, etc- No NFC (Near Field Communication) used to communicate between smartphones and some devices.- No Corning Gorilla Glass for display protection. (other model: Life One 5.0" has it)- Lack of Customer Service in my country. When I contacted customer service by email, received response just after 3 days, and almost a month later the spare arrived and could change my broken screen.- Provided headphone in-ear is not comfortableIn general, this is a great device very responsive, well designed, and good quality.

love my new phone

When i first saw it, i was impressed about how cool this phone really is, after 3 weeks i'm still amazed. Totally worth THE WAIT! 100% Recommended!

very good phone for the price, The design is very good and it works very well. i am very happy with it

The only reason it did not get 5 stars is that the Instruction manual with it is weak and incomplete, The head phone that comes with the phone doesn't make good contact with the phone and when you speak into it the recipient doesn't hear you well since it looses contact at times and has noise interference, and finally the screen saver that comes with the phone is of poor quality since no matter how hard you try it doesn't adhere completely to the phone.

Couldn't believe I could get a brand new unlocked state of the art android phone so inexpensive. Gonna buy another one soon!

I would not recommend this product to those looking for a cheaper unlocked smartphone. It has barely lasted three months and we've already sent it in for repairs and its looking like we're going to have to send it in again because the micro-usb port is flakey.With other similarly priced or slightly more expensive options that are unlocked from larger players and are far superior devices, I can't justify the $200+ cost of this phone.

I'm a real particular about cell phones, especially SIM type and Android.  I've had several BLU brand phones before and frankly they have always worked great in the US and UK where I mostly travel.  So, having a Verizon Galx 3, I wanted similar to take with me and also use as a back up.  I'm happy to report this phone is outstanding.  No issues,  no surprises, no start up issues.  Two SIM slots do not accept the same size card so beware of that issue. I neatly cut down one SIM card to mini and after trial and error, it worked.  Having said that, I could have used that size in another SIM slot but I already that filed with a DATA SIM.  This phone has plenty of &#34;power&#34; runs cool and confident.  Well worth the money if you want an Android  as primary and/or back up.  I have not tried it in the UK or out of the states yet but If my other BLU phones did well, I expect same of this one.

wifi worked but I tried both sim slots...neither of them gave me data. i am returning it... o well back to the iphone 4s

UPDATE:  After 8 days and not hearing back, I called Blu support.  They said that an email was sent, but I did not receive it.  It was not in spam, or deleted either.  They forwarded the email and here is the turnaround time for a warranty repair"The average turnaround time for all repairs is fifteen (15) business days, but in extreme cases the repair process may take a maximum of thirty (30) business days."You are reading that correctly.  15 - 30 business days.So unless you are good with being without a phone for 1 - 2 months.  DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------OK, lets start out by saying I am completely aware that all cell phones have issues.  I currently have 6 phones within my household.  I have have had dozens of phones  Every brand has had a problem at some point in time.I applaud Blu for taking the path of creating an affordable phone that satisfies 95% of what people actually need.  But they have one fatal flaw to the model.  Support!The Life Play that I purchased just 4 short months ago had an issue with the SD card reader.  No matter what card I put in, it says the card is bad and asks to reformat.  Again, these things happen.Here is where the problem begins.  I called in to support and waited for about 30 minutes to speak to someone.  The person was friendly and seemed knowledgable.  The took all of the necessary information, IMEI, Model, part number, problem with the phone etc.  They said that they would be submitting a claim to RMA/Warranty.  Again pretty standard.  He then said that he would send me an email to confirm and that I would here back in 24/48 hours.I received the email which asked for all of the same information, again.  I sent it back immediately.  30+ hours later I had not heard anything, not even a reply that they received the email, so I called back in.  I waited 45 minutes on hold then spoke to the same person who said that they just submitted the claim to RMA/Warranty.  I received the email which states that it would be 3 business days before I here back on the RMA.  So now the process is taking 4 business days to get an RMA answer.  I asked to speak to a manager and waited for an additional 15 minutes.  The manager said that I need to understand that they are the new guy and do not have the infrastructure to support a higher level of customer service and this is the best they can do.So....If you have and issue you will Submit your claim.  Wait 24 - 48 hours to see if your claim is valid, Wait 3 business days form RMA to respond.  Send the phone to them 3 days.  They look at it maybe another 3 days.  They send it back another 3 days.  Grand total:  UP TO 14 BUSINESS DAYS (ALMOST 3 ACTUAL WEEKS) TO HAVE YOUR PHONE FIXED!Morals to the story:1.  If you need a phone with responsive support, this is not the phone for you.2.  BEING THE NEW PHONE MANUFACTURER IS NOT AN EXCUSE FOR POOR SERVICE.  IT SHOULD BE YOUR MAIN PRIORITY!

Greetings , I'm from Venezuela , the phone is great , works perfect the Movistar and Movilnet in 3G and 2G with digitel, the GPS connects fast and even in places where other phones I've had or dream of doing so, I compared it with the Galaxy S3 from a friend and I can say that they do the same with very minor differences in speed, S3 has support for NFC to be what it lacks other phones so does everything and does it well , the have dual sim makes it very attractive in Venezuela , the battery is excellent using it all day with wifi and 3g GPS and some call moderate lasts all day , I have a blu Vivo 4.3 and must be charged at the end of the afternoon . The weight is excellent and accessories that brings it up to put high-end phones . I have root and works great , the camera is good, not great but good. I recommend using solo launcher that is great with this phone . In conclusion I highly recommend it for the price and quality .

Really good phone for the price only problem is that, and this is probably fixable but when the battery is low it automatically goes on power saving mode witch means I can't go online

Great phone. Yellow colors is even brighter in real life. Saves hundreds of dollars and performs up to par with other mainstream fad cell phones. Phone arrived before delivery date during the Xmas Season.

Just a quick update to let purchasers of this phone know that the Sony 64GB microSDXC Class 10 UHS-1 Memory Card [...]does work perfectly in the device. Just remember to use the phone reformat the card after installation and before use. Highly recommended.

I got this phone hoping for a economical option that would be up to date. Indeed it was a very good one up until the 30 day warranty expired then the charger stopped charging the phone. Now i have no phone and its very sad to have to dispose of a brand new phone. do not purchase it you will regret it in a month or so.

So far no complaints.  More suited for AT&T than T-Mobile because of the bands supported.

It is a very good cellphone for its price, the android version works perfect.  Good job BLU for this nice piece of hardware

Bought the White version online on eBay as amazon did not have it in stock at the time, so I'll be reviewing my experiences on the BLU Life Play from the past couple of days.My first impressions is that the phone is pretty amazing, its solid to feel in the hand and feels lightweight. At only 7.9mm thin, its almost as thin as the Samsung Galaxy S4 while having the performance reminiscence of a top-notch 2012 smartphone.So how does it perform in 2013... lets find out!BUILD QUALITY-------------The build quality is amazing, and its feels very solid to hold in the hands. the back cover is made out of plastic but unlike such models like the S4, its has a more matte finish than a glossy, making it more durable to hold in the hands. Has 4GB of internal storage and only ~1GB is accessible but you can add an external micro SD card up to 32 GB (I have one and it works). Has a dual sim slots (1 mini and 1 micro) and its unlocked as well so you can use with any GSM service provider with the correct APN settings.Performance-----------With a 1.2 Quad-Core processor, its pretty fast and also has 1 GB of RAM. The phone runs smooth but you'll feel the occasional lag when opening/switching apps very quickly. But all apps I have tested so far (Facebook, Youtube, Gmail, Maps) runs without any problems. For the geeks, my quadrant score was 4068, so still pretty good but far less than the top-notch.Battery Life------------With a 1800 mAh battery that is removable, I was able to get though a full day somewhere between 60-70% left and that was with a single phone call, some web browsing, and texting. So my rating of the battery life on this phone is pretty good and it will last.Software--------Comes with Android Jelly Bean 4.2.1, while not the very latest, you'll still get things like lockscreen widgets, google now, etc. Its a pretty stock version with some included apps and a settings menu that looks different. Feels pretty quick and easy to navigate as well.Camera/GPS------Has a 8 mp rear and a 2 mp front. Haven't taken any official photos but with a few quick captures, my judgement is the quality is good and pictures were nice and clear. The flash is pretty bright so get very used to it.The GPS also works pretty nicely and you will get a quick lock with the device with accurate location.Call Quality------------Call Quality is good, my first call the user sounded very soft but after using voice mail on full volume, definitely wasn't a phone problem. Speakers work nice too and its loud but not too loud.Conclusion----------Pros that I like about this phone is a) Price b) Build Quality is exceptional and c) Good battery lifeCons are its not the fastest and smoothest device but definitely not slow either, the vibration/volumes could be stronger and I'm still quirky about the support from the company BLU and any future updates this phone will get.Overall, very happy with the device and it comes with a screen protector and case, USB cable, charger, cleaning cloth, pair of earbuds, and of course the phone itself. Definitely recommend buying this phone if your on a tight budget but want something current with the latest version of Android.

I am an IT Technician and a graphic designer and this phone do me well. I just love it. No regrets whatsoever.  price is sweet too.

I bought three BLU PHONES, BLU Life Play-1/23/14, BLU Studio 5.0 D530- 12/19/13, BLU Dash 5.0 D410a-1/31/14 and they all have charging port problems. The blu Life Play will not charge at all. Charging port is defective. I would like to return the BLU Life Play for repairs.Thank you

The Electric Blue Life Play phone is amazing!!Almost as good as the Samsung Galaxy S3 I sold to get out of the one year I had left on my T Mobile contract.Just wished it had more internal storage plus more ram memory & would support a micro 64 GB SD Card.I was worried at first about not getting 4 G speed, but I'm getting almost that with Metro PCS. I tested the battery as the 1800 mah also had me concerned. No need for anyone who is thinking about buying this cell phone to worry about that at al. After fully charging it overnight. I unplugged it the next morning at 7 am & used it all day making phone calls & downloading & installing all my apps plus restoring all my text massages plus my call log. At 10 PM that night I had 24 minutes to go after using it all day.I installed a 32 GB SD Card from the start & all my apps plus everything else goes directly to the SD Card as to not use up the remaining 4 GB Internal storage. Today has been a light day of use & cell phone has been off the charger since 9 AM This morning & I have 80% battery left. I like that you can turn the data connection off so you don't use up your data as then the phone won't be checking for updates all the time. This phone takes great photos also. I also bought the BLU Studio 5;5 but did not the screen being that big plus only has 5.0 mega pixel camera & pictures are not as good as an 8.0 camera is, so sold it to a friend.One feature I really like is you can have the phone turn off & then come back on anytime you want. I do this how I'm sleeping as it does not need to be on when I'm a sleep. but then I don't need to worry about turning it back on as I have alarms set to remind me to take my morning medications. To me y phone is more than just something to talk on. I'm a computer repair tech so the number is in all my ads & people text me questions & to see how much I charge to fix their computer.I also have a device that plugs into the 3.5 mm jack that I can take credit cards right on my cell phone for my repair service when I do an onsite call. The best part about this phone that I like is no more $90 a month high price for unlimited everything plus paying $350 to $500 for a good cell phone. I got unlimited everything with Metro PCS for $35 a month & no contract. That is the part I like the best. I also like the fact that the phone has US Support as a lot of the China phones don't unless they are from one of the name brands. You cant go wrong with this phone if your wanting an unlocked phone that does not coast a lot of money.

I really like this phone!! I'm more than impressed. I love the quality of this product and the price was just icing on the cake.

you know how every set of phones manufactured has a few that have gliches? well thankfully this one works like a charm so far. its been about a month and its really great. i actually bought it as an early Christmas present for my husband. he wanted a Samsung phone but economically this one is wiser. it can stand up to the Galaxy S-III, so its worth the buy if you're looking for something to work with your wallet.

I LOVE MY NEW BLU LIFE PLAY PHONE!!! OMG I PURCHASED IT YESTERDAY AND GOT IT TODAY SUPER FAST SHIPPING!!! I just put my sim card in and was up and running in seconds. This phone is super sleek and thin very bright in display. It runs AMAZING !!!!! My friend was super jealous of my phone and is waiting until I get tired of it and give it to him...but that's not happening !! Sorry boo boo. If you are looking for a high end phone like the S3 or iPhone you can't go wrong with this phone for $229.99 you getba lot of bang for your buck !!! You need to get this phone ASAP !!

I purchased this phone in Jan. By Feb the headphones that came with it died. Shortly thereafter the phone began automatically reset itself several times a day. I performed a factory reset twice and I still have the same problem. Also the phone gets extremely hot and I'm afraid it may catch fire.I would not recommend this product to anyone at all. $222.00 spent was not worth it.This is my first Blu purchase and certainly my last!!

Love this phone, my wife has the pink one and I just ordered the White color one tonight for myself. Phone has to be one of the best on the market for the best price and still get that android jelly bean 4.1. So, you really can't complain at all.... We have ours connected with Solavei Phone service... they have like 4 plan options to choose from no contract and if you spread the news you can even get your bill free monthly... so heck... im in. There signal is back up by T-mobile and we love it here in san antonio nationwide go check them out . [...] distributes Solavei phone service. Great phones! Use the Standard Sim Card size! 3G hspa+ etc...

Slick phone that came with all the fixings (screen protector, car charger, and protective case) and great specs at a reasonable price point. Runs quick and smooth with very few glitches. Pandora lock screen can glitch out, bluetooth connected well to most my devices, some issue with some version 1 bluetooth headphones, but anything 2.0 and later was fine. Compared to my Galaxy the Play doesn't pick up as strong of a signal on t-Mobile. Didn't see the claimed 42mbps data speeds but in all fairness t-Mobile has always given me issues with data. Biggest issue was I bought the Life Play and the battery will last 8 hours only if it spends most of the time in standby mode or use it hard for a 2 hours then have to kill all apps and plug it in. Blu customer service was no help, blamed apps, said "phone needs 10 min. rest with battery removed DAILY", who does this? Sending back the Play in hopes the Studio will give me a phone I can use without needing to be plugged in all day or giving it battery free milk & cookie naps.

My problem is I bought the BLU Life One first, so this one, which is less expensive, suffers in comparison. Everything works, good display etc, but I miss the 13 mp camera, this one &#34;only&#34; has 8 mp. It is a little smaller than the One, which is the reason I bought it. this one is about the size of the Galaxy IIIs, so I figure I could get a waterproof case for it easier than for the One.Probably would have assigned 5 stars if I had purchased this phone first.

Meet my expectations only thing wish it came with more on board  memory but other that that the phone works great

I ordered this phone in December and decided to wait 3 months before writing a review. I agree with other users that the manual does not give much information but the phone itself is pretty straight forward and easy to navigate. It takes quality pictures and the quality and clarity of the sound is good. The features are great and the battery lie any other smart phone will last based on your usage of the device. I am pleased with my purchase and will definitely look at this brand first for future purchase

I love this phone, I ordered two and they work perfect. I surf and make calls and text with lighting speed. Have more than one page up and apps. Dual sims and perfect with T-Mobile..

very good phone with impressive features competitive with the latest phone, and a great price ... Highly recommended. We are very pleased

I really like this phone, but it's not perfect:The Great:Blu Life Play comes with a custom clear case - very nice having that as part of the package!!  Easy to pop in sim & micro sd, turn on and make calls immediately.  Battery life's terrific.  Camera's great.  Beautiful screen, easy interface (though different from gingerbread); side by side to the Galaxy S it looks like a sleek & slender cousin.  Phone calls are clear.  All the built-in's (wifi, bluetooth, video), work well.The Glitchy:1) APN settings had to be manually set before data worked - using AT&T; mvno, had to look up correct settings and adjust a couple of times to get any data at all.2) No Netflix - researched, tried to get working... nope :-( Frustrating, since I could watch Netflix w/gingerbread.3) Charging port felt wiggly from the start.  Within a week it went caput. Not recognized when connected to pc, and have to manipulate charging cord just right and hold in place to charge... grumble grumble...Sending back to Amazon for replacement.  Not giving up because it's great being contract free with a smart phone that does (most) of what I like.  Will rate replacement fairly too.UPDATE 8-7-13:The Blu Life Play's wireless update has fixed Netflix!  The replacement phone arrived and charges/syncs as it should :)  Manually adjusted APN settings first thing.  So far phone has worked flawlessly!!

For someone interested in the life with a Samsung Galaxy S3 but can't afford that high price I recommend this phone. The BLU Life Play is handling same games I play on S3 and doing it at about same speed no lag. Feels so much lighter in weight as well thinner, it accepted my service with no problems (Family Mobile) it runs so smooth and seems very unique. So I rate this product with high regard and recommend this phone to people who travel BECAUSE of a dual SIM option, you might not have your provider in certain areas of world and just need temp prepaid SIM to cover that vacation. Bravo BLU!

I got the BLU Life for my wife who lives in Jamaica and so far she love it.  So far all I know is that Skype and the camera work great

Great phone all around, it has everything that you need in a smartphone at a reasonable cost, don't pay 500 that's ridiculous.I decided to get this after deciding the camera wasn't good enough on the BLU Advance 4.5 Unlocked Dual SIM Phone (Black), which I had returned for this. (this has the 8mp camera which is what you need for quality)I wish there was a speakerphone on the front and a little more editing options on the camera, but it's ok, there's apps for the camera thing too. I like the 4.5&#34; screen too it's perfect, and ya charger is on top which is rare now but you get used to it.After researching a lot, this phone I highly suggest.

Very disappointing order this item an had to pay full price as the phone stated new on the website an now I received it.its a refurbished phone.not acceptable well not recommend very bad service an not professional at all

The phone works as expected and I like that it is very easy to get to the internals of the phone.But since the beginning I started to have an occasional problem. I will plug in the charger, leave it overnight, in the morning the battery was discharged. It turns out that the USB cable won't make good contact unless tilted to the front or the back of the phone.Very inconvenient for a new phone. Now it happens all the time and the phone is 2 months old. I've tried different cables with the same result. I'm waiting to see how good is their customer service since Amazon won't take the phone back after 30 days.Update(09/16/2013): The Blu support team agreed to check the phone and see if this is covered by the warranty.Update(10/5/2013): Blu returned the phone after changing the main board. So far, so good. But I'm glad to see Blu responded.

I was very skeptical when purchasing this phone and the pictures were not very convincing. The price was very compelling though and I continued doing my research. Upon receiving the phone I was very very impressed. The phone was pretty slim and well  designed. The response is very smooth and picture quality is good. Very good buy. Not sure if I could have got another phone with Android 4.2.2 for this price.

BLU is coming up in the world with this phone but it has a long way to go before it's up to the peak when it comes to good budget phones.Ascetically it's a very pleasing phone, the screen is very bright and pretty vivid. The viewing angles BLU was able to achieve without having to go with an AMOLED screen is great. The design language is great the phone is slim and light not too unwieldy despite it being a larger screen phone.Performance wise, there are very few hiccups as the Quad Core Cortex A7 processor can handle tasks easily, this isn't a chart breaker but this isn't sluggish by any means. However don't expect this phone to be a gamer's delight as you can eat through battery very quickly if you're playing more graphically intensive games. Battery life can be mixed as it doesn't have the greatest power user in mind, but with mixed usage you can get through a day easily and if you're a light user you can probably get the phone to last 2 to 3 days by using the power saver function that BLU has built in.The main reason why this phone doesn't get a high mark from me is that there is a possible defect that users could run into with the Micro-USB port, in that it could get bent and thus make it almost neigh impossible to get the phone to charge and or sync with a computer. I ran into this defect and had to send the phone back to Amazon because of it. Such a shame because it has the potential to be a great phone and value, however I can't fully recommend it because of the defect.

It's pretty, it's fast, it's big! Specs are all correct, white was the one I got and I'm happy with my choice. This thing is as thin if not thinner than an s4. The battery in this phone goes pretty quick. If the screen is off it'll drain about 15% in 8 hours (with wifi and service on), but the battery while the screen is on goes through about 5% in 10 minutes. So depending on how you're using your phone, the battery may need some charging in the middle of the day. For some reason on this phone the music player doesn't let you save a playlist... so I had to get an app for that.FOR NET10 USERS:To get 3g hspa+ on this phone you need to enter the following, rather than the default or net10 apn. This is Access Point Names.Name: Cingular 410APN: tcdata 1MMS Proxy: 66.209.11.33Authentication Type: PAPThat's it, just save, set and restart your phone and you should have working 3g+I hope this saves Net 10 users some grief, it was very annoying to find out.

It is fast, colorful, cheap and easy to use. However, as I have said, it's really noisy when vedio chatting, I don't know if only mine has this problem... If others are fine, I just have bad luck.

DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR YOUR MONEY. I HAD THE PHONE FOR LESS THAN TWO MONTHS BEFORE IT STOPPED CHARGING, I HAVE TRIED TO GET IT FIXED AT DIFFERENT PLACES WITH NO LUCK, THEY SAY I NEED A NEW PANEL...I JUST GOT THE PHONE!!!!!!!!!!

I have been using my new Blu Life Play for about 5 days and I am extremely satisfied. A very fast processor, good battery life, decent call quality, a great (non-bloat ware) install of Jelly Bean 4.2, and a very simple OS. Blu got this thing right. I recommend it to anyone looking for a decent new android device at a fraction of the cost of the name brand products. Comes with everything you need, including a protective case and screen protector. My best purchase this year!

For the price it is a very good phone. It is lacking in battery power and memory. It runs rather smoothly. The one thing that doesn't work is the audio jack. Sound through my Munitio Billets is very distorted, and just straight out bad. Sound through them from my computer and ipod sound perfectly fine, so it is not a headphone defect. Other than that it is a good phone, but I would not recomend buying it.

I really like this phone. The display and features are great (except the fact that it lacks a notification LED!). Its speed in comparison to its features (CPU, memory, ...) seems a bit slow, but not annoying at all: For this price, it's fast enough!My main problem with this phone is that i think it's not reliable much!The first phone that I ordered, had a rattling sound whenever the vibration was working... It was a bit disturbing and after a bit of searching I was convinced that I should return it.The second phone that I received has not that problem, but it's resetting itself randomly! I've searched and read that its cause can be the battery or the softwares that I've installed... So I did a factory reset and tried to monitor its behavior after installing softwares... I like this phone much so that I prefer not to return it again!I would have given it a 5 star without a hesitation if I've hadn't the problems I mentioned above.

I was initially really happy with my decision of getting the Blu Life Play as compared to the Samsung S3. I even recommended my friends to get Blu as well if they were interested in getting a new phone. The phone had great performance, good camera and good battery life for such a low price. However, my phone later stopped charging just after 4months+ of usage. Now I am back in my home country and it seems like nothing can be done. End up having to get a cheap lenovo phone to use for the time being.Very bumped that no assistance was provided as well following a request form I sent to them. Wasted $200+. I guess that's what you get when you are paying such a low price? So to all of you out there.. buy at your own risk? you may or may not end up like me.

After 3 weeks, the phone decided to stop charging. Not only that, but the phone had some hiccups whenever I tried entering my messaging app, sometimes the screen would go completely black and I would have to enter and exit it a couple of times before it cleared up. I live in Florida and attempted to use it for metropcs, so getting to my 3g metropcs service was always a hassle because the phone would automatically select T-Mobile's E1 network (which is the slowest network there is. Therefore I would have to go on manually almost everyday in order to &#34;manually select&#34; my network provider. Lastly, the phone would lose all data connection at the most random of places and times. The camera was &#34;ok&#34; nothing really to brag about. However the screen size was awesome and the graphics were always crystal clear.

The phone is fantastic they only problem is the battery sucks!!! Also the case for the pink one doesn't fit properly so when you use the flash with the case in you will see some of the pink.

The Blue Life Play is an amazing phone..very similar to galexy s4...beautyful slim design..compadible with T-Mobile..sim card....Blu packages this phone in a cool..frustration free box..no plastic to cut...and it comes with ear buds that double and an antenna for listening to the radio(only with ear buds) a screen protector and a transparent silicon case that matches the color of the phone you choose...blue..pink..clear for the white...and yellow and grey.Front facing camera for Skype or what have you...8mpxl camera with zoom....Android os..jellybean 4.2.1I absolutely adore this phone..I needed a new phone badly..I have an old Samsung galexy..I think it was the first one....about 2 years old at least...I was very excited to get this phone...I saw good reviews for it and the sleek design and multiple color options lured me right in!! I chose the blue..and I'm very happy with my choice..yellow would've been my second choice as it isn't common to see yellow phones. The fact that it comes with extras is very cool..everything you need to get started...and the price of only $227 allows individuals on a budget to own a really nice device comparable to high end devices like galexys4..which easily go for $500 -$600 and up. Blu offers a stylish device with pretty much everything stock that you would get with comparable devices. Web browsing quick...and with a 4.7 inch screen watching YouTube and other videos is delightful to say the least!So anyone needing a new phone..of course check compatibility first...I would definitely recommend the blu life play cell phone!!**Anyone else who has this phone I would love to hear what you think about it this is my second day on the phone and I've had no issues thus far and I'm really enjoying it!**

I LOVED THIS PHONE SINCE THE FIRST DAY, ITS VERY FAST, THIN, BIG SCREEN, BEAUTIFUL RESOLUTION, ETC; BUT, THIS PHONE IS MISSING THE 1700 AND 2100 BANDS FROM T-MOBILE AND ONLY HAS 1900, T-MOBILE FIXED THE 1900 BAND TO WORK AT 42MBPS BUT ONLY IN URBAN AREAS, ON THE CITY THE PHONE IS "SUPER GREAT", BUT ONCE I AM IN RURAL AREAS OR HIGHWAYS OUTSIDE THE CITIES IT WORKS MOSTLY ON EDGE (2G). FOR ATT USERS I WILL RECOMMEND IT, "YOU'LL LOVE IT" IT HAS 850/1900 FOR YOU.TOO BAD SUCH A GREAT PHONE BUT HAS LIMITED DATA USAGE FOR T-MOBILE USERS. AN UNLOCKED PHONE SHOULD BE UNLOCKED FOR EVERY CARRIER AND NOT JUST FOR ONE CARRIER, I WOULD CONSIDER IT AS AN ATT PHONE MORE THAN AN UNLOCKED PHONE. ONE LAST THING IS THAT BLU SHOULD HAVE ACCESSORIES AVAILABLE FOR THE PRODUCTS THEY SELL. I'M TAKING ONE STAR FOR THE MISSING BANDS AND ONE FOR NO AVAILABLE ACCESSORIES FROM BLU. PLEASE DO YOUR RESEARCH BEFORE YOU BUY AN "UNLOCK" PHONE. T-MOBILE WORKS ON 1700/2100 NATIONWIDE AND WILL USE 1900 TOO, BUT ONLY ON URBAN AREAS. YOUR PHONE NEEDS BOTH 1700/2100 (TOGETHER)TO WORK NATIONWIDE, IF ONE OF THEM IS MISSING IT WILL WORK ONLY 2G. SIMPLE; THE L100A (850/1900) WORKS GOOD ONLY ON THE CITY. L100I IS USELESS FOR T-MOBILE, ONLY 2G ALWAYS.

I treated myself to this phone as a late Christmas present. For 5 months it worked fine. I was ecstatic to find that not only Netflix but Hulu apps were supported on my device. Reception worked well not great; on Metro PCS (then again I live away from most towers so I say fair on cell reception because out in the city it was on and popping). AND the battery life was the best I have ever had on any smart phone!!Last month the phone stopped charging. Call it operator error, I think not. Neither the original charger nor others would charge. Only having had my phone 5 months (I MUST BE UNDER FACTORY WARRENTY, RIGHT?)I wrote the vendor: BLUTEKUSA = Nothing. No confirmation of email, reply no resolution = no phone.I wrote the manufacturer : BLUProducts =Nothing!! No Help, Comments, resolve or assistance of any sort.I just disappoints and pisses me off at the lack of integrity. Just stand by your product or don't sell it. They have no problem taking our money, but so help you God if you need them to hold up their end.So in summation, as I don't happen to have hundreds of dollars sitting around. Compared to what smart phones cost these days I thought this was a good deal, I saved and budgeted and bought it. But if YOU happen to have $$$ laying around you can take a chance. It's a good phone, cute, slim, budget friendly. If it craps out on you, it just crapped out on you because neither BLUPRODUCTS nor BLUTEKUSA are going to lift a finger or text to help.

Received my phone about 2 weeks ago.  I'm using this with Net10 (AT&T) and couldn't be happier.  I have been searching for the perfect phone and carrier and finally found them.  The BLU Life Play has a crystal clear display, is extremely fast, and is as thin as a pencil!  The battery life is average (I wish it was better) however it takes a full charge in about 45 - 60 minutes so I can live with it.  I would recommend this phone - next best thing to a Samsung Galaxy at a third of the price!!! Buy it - you will be glad you did!!!

great phone, low price, you cant loose. i had a s3 then it broke, i bought a temp phone(inspire 4g). was not happy with speed but didnt want to spend a fortune for an up to date phone. found this phone and thought why not, i trust the rating system and it came through for me again. very very pleased with this phone. i dont notice any difference from s3 to this. i guess i would classify myself as a typical user

Nice but sadly it make lots of updates and keep reestarting until a month ago...but I like it a  Lot take picss and videoss

This phone for its low cost works very well. Its very responsive and once you purchase a microsd to handle your storage its even better.The Good:Great screen, very responsive,The Bad:Calender crashed once, phone froze once, needs more ramConclusion:You get what you pay for its not a galaxy but it is a great phone, it will do all the tasks you need , once you hace a microsd and an app to manage the system (Clean Master) this phone works well :-)

I ordered this phone for my wife as she is not a heavy gamer etc just a typical cell phone user.  This phone is an excelent choice for normal users.  The screen is nice and the build quality is good. The phone arrives already pretty low on storage space so a 32 gb sd card is a must.  Thankfully you have the option to store all your app's photos and videos onto the sd card so no worries about space.  When the new view comes out (soon I hope) I will purchase one of those as well.  I would recommend this phone for the normal day to day user.

Good android phone. But the charger sufered an unexpected damage and stop working.I think it came broken or something

This is an awesome phone. Its fast, the resolution is crisp and clear, and it does everything I need it to do without being packed full of extra features that I will probably never use. It is a really good alternative for someone looking for an S3 or S4 but doesn't want to spend all that money. The design is simple but stylish. Only downside is that there aren't that many accessories for it yet.

So if the Samsung Galaxy S4 had a baby with the iphone 5c, it would be the Blu Life Play. I like this phone very much. However it is very light but has the same height as the S4... personally I think the camera quality is pretty good considering the price... i mean its much better than my 2011 HTC Sensation 4G... A lot of people say they encounter a problem with the charger... i didn't... and even if i did i know the charging port is the same size as my HTC's charching port and the same size as the Samsung S4 charging port so if the charger it comes with does't work you can buy a Samsung Galaxy S4 charger and it will work the same.... i also noticed that for this phone their aren't many phone cases so what you can do is go to aliexpress.com and they have a variety of nice cases... or you could just make your own by getting a Samsung Galaxy S4 silicon case and cutting a whole where the speaker and camera are suppose to go and put a cute sticker where the Samsung's camera is suppose to be so it doesnt look weird... overall its a great phone..BTW THE BATTERY ON THIS THIS ROCKS! IN 8 HOURS MY HTC'S BATTERY LIFE WOULD BE AT 15% AND WITH THE BLU LIFE PLAY AFTER 8 HOURS ITS LIKE AT 40% BUT THATS BECAUSE I USE THE APPS LIKE CRAZY :)

Love it one of the best purchases I have ever made .. It is well worth the 230 dollars .

I bought this phone almost 2 months ago, and I have to say that I am pleased with my BLU life play. I compared it with many other devices and the blu always wins. Some people say that this phone has problems with the sound and it isn't true, I listen music all day long and have no problem... also I was impressed with the sound because it has DTS (a Dolby like feature) that gives you the option of focusing the music, boost the bass, add 3D effect, have more clarity and to adjust the music space reverberation. The phone works with any kind of headphones.About the performance, the phone has a quad-core processor so doesn't have lag even with several apps opened at the same time. The gaming is amazing, it handles heavy games like "Dead trigger" in high resolution with no lag.I hope that BLU continues the updates because it makes the costumer happy. I would recommend this phone to every one, its a good choice for the price and for the performance.

Excelent phone i buy the phone for use in Venezuela and works perfecly, excelent perfomance like a Galaxy s3 only that cost 200 dollars less.Works in 3g in the sim slot 1, movilnet or movistar, digitel only 2g.

Top of the line, this celular is over muy espectations...., is usefull and thin, and hardware is like one of the top

So far I am extremely impressed with this phone. I just got it today 12/11/13. I will start by saying I am coming from a Samsung Vibrant...Pros:1)The display is great! (I am used to amoled from the Vibrant which did have better blacks but about equal viewing angle, the Blu Life Play has IPS display type). The Blu Life Play display has higher pixel density and everything seems to be more accurate as far as color reproduction goes.2)The speed of the device is more than acceptable for the cost. I notice no lag time between apps and everything runs well. Web browsing and youtube is smooth.3) Micro SD slot (supported my 32gb card no problem) For those that may be worried about the 4gb of internal storage, you can get a 32gb micro sd card for dirt cheap and install your apps to that.4) At first I had no idea what the connection on the device was, it did not say 2g, 3g, or 4g. I did the (Over the air) update v13 which was released 11/10/2013. After the update near the tower bars you now see how the phone is connected 2g,3g,H+ etc. So far I have seen 3g and H+. I did a speed test while the phone said H+ and saw download speeds of 9.62Mb/s and upload speeds 3.1Mb/s!All I can say is wow! I am using this phone on straight talk with T-mobile sim. (I will include my apn settings at the bottom of the review. On my Samsung Vibrant in the very same location as this phone my max was 3.7Mb/s down and 1.6Mb/s up. So this is quite a step up. I was worried that I may be in an area with 2g only as this phone uses only HSDPA 850 / 1900 (not standard 850/1700/1900/2100 it is missing 1700/2100). I must be lucky because I am 40 miles outside a major city and still have H+!!!! T-mobile has been re-farming 1900mhz bands and eventually most people should have 3g or H+ on 1900mhz frequency.5) The phone comes with a clear gel cover (I have the white version of the phone) and it looks great even with the case. It also comes with headphones that are ear bud style which happen to be my favorite!I have used my Sennheiser CX 300B MK II Precision Enhanced Bass Ear buds and I can say that it sounds absolutely amazing! I have no issues with my Sony ear buds either. I am not sure why people are having problems with headsets? Maybe there is a problem with mic in line headsets? So far I have not had any problems.UPDATE: Pros 6 and 7) The battery life is surprisingly good considering the size. The FM radio works very well, I get better reception with the phone than I do with my receiver that has a much larger antenna. The headphones are good but have too much bass for me personally.Cons:1) This device has very limited internal storage, user available is 1.64gb out of the box... However since this phone has a micro sd card slot and they allow you to install apps to the sd card, there really is no need to take a star away, People report some 64gb cards working (I have not tried) but if this is true then you really have no reason to complain about storage.2) Accessories can be tough to find, try searching for Symphony W150, Allview V1 Viper, General Mobile DISCOVERY, Polytron W8470, Fly IQ4410 Quad Phoenix, Qmobile Noir A900 accessories as they should work for the Blu Life Play as well.UPDATE Con #3) The camera is terrible in low light. You may as well be using a 1 megapixel camera with a real flash. It is extremely grainy in low light and there are no details. It seems to work well in bright day light.If you have an extra $150 get the Nexus 5 from the google play store, all around the nexus 5 has better specs and kit kat 4.4. (If you're like me and do not game on your phone or don't like spending $349.99 on a phone get the Blu Life Play! I am certainly happy I got the Blu Life Play. I have no need for LTE networks and do not game on my phone.My current Straight Talk T-Mobile APN settings(To change this, go to system settings then Mobile networks, then Access point names.

Amazing phone for the price ! I am really happy with it, is fast and nice looking. I live in Mexico and the phone works excellent.

To preface my review, may star rating is for the phone only. The other information is in regards to the experience of purchasing a BLU product, Blu's service and communication as well as trying to obtain this product.The Phone:The phone is not really a Blu Product, it is actually a rebrand of a phone that comes off the KTouch line in China and it's sold as a Geonee Elife E3 in India and General Mobile Discovery in North Asia. Blu, a Florida based company basically patched their intro and English ROM for the US market. The good news is that because this phone was picked up by many "Rebranders" over the last few months, it does show its impeccable taste to engineers alike for its durability and ability to utilize JB4.2. The platform is well built, the phone is sleek and I see no issues with battery or processor performance. It is a very good phone for the price and rivals the Samsung line very well.BLU Products Inc.Blu needs to work on Customer Service, they will get it right eventually but this obviously takes time. Facebook and Twitter are their main modes of communication. But they really don't troubleshoot, just tell you to return their phones to where you purchased them... That is another issue; Make sure you buy from the website they tell you. They do not seem to honor specific warranties from select website. Just buy from Amazon and you will be OK.I initially ordered a Grey Life Play, 10 minutes after Amazon's posting. It took 4 weeks to process the order, 1 week to prepare shipping and then the order was cancelled by amazon because BLU never sent amazon the grey phones. They basically just disappeared from existence, Blu never gave amazon or myself an explanation, but I was destined to get the Life Play so I picked my second choice, Blue Blu life play. I'm a bit pissed off about this and have been scouring the websites to find I am not alone ... I also hear that the Life One has also been removed from production.  I call these small company growing pains, ill attention, poor service and communication. The Life was released in March, delayed through June and shipped in July... Select Colors on a broken promise to deliver on time...When BLU grows up and beefs up their service and support, then they will be successful. For now, they are just a small little rebrander.

Honestly took 5 days with the phone and I can say that is the best .. It's a GREAT phone .. At a very low price you can have functions of a $ 500 phone! I recommend it for all, I must admit I'm in love with this phone!

I've had, the original G1 android phone, My Touch Slide, iPhone 4, Nexus S 4G, and the Galaxy Nexus. This phone is by far the lightest and thinnest phone I've ever owned. Snappy like my Galaxy Nexus but so thin and light. The case that comes with it is far better quality than expected HOWEVER, it does seem to cause my phone to constantly reboot because the volume holes and power hole don't align properly. If anyone can manipulate these holes (i.e. cut them out and make the holes bigger than problem solved. I poked holes in it and haven't experienced a reboot in a few days. I also went online and found a case that's suppose to fit it. Still waiting on it to come but we will see. I love being able to set the destination of where my apps download to. Works exactly like Apps to SD though. Now take this with a grain of salt, I put juice defender on my phone and set custom settings, my work place has spotty wifi so i relied on that for syncing, but rarely took out my phone throughout the work day to check things, on a 12 hour workday with minimal use my battery drained 3% to be at 97% when I got home. How this works with moderate to heavy use has yet to be tested. One VERY IMPORTANT thing to keep in mind. After reading reviews about the charging port becoming non-respondent or loose, I found that the usb cable that came with mine has VERY strong clamps that keep in from coming out which is good until you have to unplug it. So when unplugging your cable be advised or find a cable that doesn't hook to securely. Camera seems to be very good. Once again take it with a grain a salt. I was coming from a 5 mega pixel camera but when trying to compare low light photos this phone was way better in low light conditions but I'm not sure if its just the mega pixel difference or if its just an overall better quality camera. Colors are pretty saturated but still nice to eye even though there not true colors. Everyone says the speaker isn't loud but upon playing music mine seems just as loud if not louder than my Galaxy Nexus so it seems fine to me. The app drawer is fine but the apps don't sort in alphabetical order, they just appear in what ever order you download apps. I downloaded Nova Launcher and fixed that but if that doesn't bother you then no big deal. Will update if anything else I forgot to mention.Updated: 10/29/2013-I have used juice defender with custom settings and after a 9 hour work day with moderate use, my battery has been drained to 73%. Not bad, for a new up and coming product. I have received a case from ebay that matches this phones size and I must say it really complements the phone's style. A great secure case for a great phone. The GPS leaves alot to be desired. It works for basic use but don't rely on it. Just gathering a turn by turn works great but actually having street by street turn as you go may not always work. Haven't run into a problem with the charging port but I found an old micro usb charger that goes in and releases without problem so I dont expect to have charging port problems but we shall see. The OS continues to run smooth coupled with Advance Task Manager Pro to end apps every few minutes or so. Most important apps I am using would be Advance Task Manager, Juice Defender Ultimate, and Nova Launcher. I find that these apps replace any flaws that may come up in other reviews as far as a software issue. Will continue to update as the days go by and I find anything else useful to report.

this phone is really nice in its class, does a lot of things including call recording , your friends can't lie to you as you have the opportunity to recall or recorded calls .fast, slim and solid.

Previously got BLU VIVO, I thought that was a great phone for the price with dual core.  But this one is even better with great for the price, unlocked and with two SIM card slots.  Great processing speed.  It is like Samsung S4 but not at the same cost.  I like it that much that I am buy another one for my relative.

No problems at all with this phone works well does everything i need it to and even the gps which others complained about has no problems for me at all

the best investment I made, the cell was at the height behaved ... in all its expression has given a good performance ... the BLU product are made &#8203;&#8203;of good tough and durable materials, cel recommend this 100%

I finally upgraded to a smartphone and did lots of research. This phone was a great buy, not just for the price.I had the phone now for three weeks and I still have not reached any limitations with the factory setting. I plan on getting another storage card sometime in the future.

This phone is amazing, you will not find a better phone at this price. Its very thin and well made.

I've been with Android phones for a while now. I've had the G1, Nexus One, Infuse, Galaxy Nexus, and Galaxy S. This phone is better than most of them as it is off-contract, does not include the "Jerky Boys and Girls" at AT&T;, and has an almost unlimited battery. I used to have to charge all my other phones once or twice per day. I only charge this one every other day. The screen is beautiful, very thin, and is lightening fast. I have not yet installed two SIM cards at the same time as I do not have a need for it now, but it is nice to have for the future. Keep in mind that SIM Slot 1 is a "mini SIM" (not nano like the phones that hook up to iTunes) and SIM Slot 2 is a standard SIM. The phone works great with no SIMs installed and also with just one installed. For AT&T; customers, there is a change you need to make in the Data settings (one time, forever) in order to get it to work. Just look up "BLU Play ATT" on YouTube, there are complete instructions. This is not my video, but the video helped me a great deal. After that, my experiences with the phone have been top-notch!I highly recommend this phone. Totally worth it, especially if you are "grandfathered" in to Unlimited Data and don't want to risk your carrier dropping it by upgrading your phone/changing your contract.

It does not have the feel of a top of the line Samsung Galaxy S4, but it does everything plus more!  I was greatly surprised that it has an actual FM radio and works great--you need to use the supplied ear buds because the wiring acts as the antenna.  No problems with rooting and adding a customized ROM.  After I made all of my optimizations it only uses one third of the supplied 1G RAM.  I have not had any issues with running slow.  You will want to add an external micro SD, so make sure you have one available.  I filled up the internal 4G (about 1.5G is used for the OS) of memory fast with apps.  I used a 16G mSD that I had laying around and it worked fine.  I do love this phone.  I use it on AT&T with no problems.  Highly recommended and I would definitely buy one again.

Great ...!! is in the elite of Smartphones to a much more accessible price, the touch is sensitive enough and easy to use system. Very importantly unlike other phones, can connect to a PC and a Mac and recognize both systems.

When you buy this phone you are buying the same QUALITY and PERFORMANCE of the big &#34;name brand&#34; phones like apple, htc, and samsung. I've owned them so I would know. This phone DELIVERS on everything! I was just a bit skeptical about buying an &#34;off&#34; brand phone but upon reading reviews from others I decided to try it. The reason is that I was sick of paying &#34;premium&#34; prices for cell service with verizon. NOT doing it anymore! I now use straightalk service paired with the Life Play and it's AWSOME. I get 4G speeds(H+) with the sim from straightalk and love it. There is a few steps to set up the phone, like setting the APN, but I think just about anyone can do it.It's worth the $$$ so far. I will post a followup review in about one month.

Its a superb phone, I needed a dual sim phone and this one did the trick, great battery, screen, performance and everything.The only caveat, the headphone jack. The headphones that do come with the phone are ok, they appear to be of great quality, but they dont fit nice to me... so I started looking for alternatives. The problem arrived when I tried other units (with mic included) and non worked. Apparently this phone uses an old standard called OMTP which almost non of the new headsets (with mic) uses. Ill be buying an experia 10 headset and probably this will do the trick.Besides this, 5 stars!

It's a great phone - bought it in Sept. 2013 in white. Love the dual SIM Card - especially as I use it overseas as well. It does work fine, have no connection problems at all. I wasn't sure before I bought it if it would work in Germany as well but it does!The price is amazing for an unlocked phone with all its features. The camera does pretty nice pictures, texting, surfing in the internet - just everything you need is possible.Everbody who sees it thinks it is a Samsung and are amazed that it is a BLU phone and regarding to other reviewers I don't have any charger problems.Only the provided headphones are uncomfortable - I use my iPhone ones.I highly recommend BLU Life Play, if you are looking for a cell phone which is reasonable in prize - go for it!I would buy it again.

this phone is by far amazing, compared to my old motorola defy android 2.3 os and slow internet and all that with constantly dropping calls, after getting this phone and getting my sim installed, its one hell of a phone, for me fast internet even without a wi fi connection, phone is clear, i get reception in my apartment unlike the motorola defy, i have 2-3 bars usually crystal clear. phone is great, very fast, and looks great.. picture quality is amazing.. video quality is amazing.. i definitely recommend this phone, especially for the its functions/options, its like 1/3 price of a new brand name phone like samsung or your typical i phone

such a great phone for the price. if you're looking for an off-contract entry level phone that performs very well, looks great and has some really nice people backing it up, look no further.

BLU Life Play is a really solid mid-range Android smartphone. And for the price it is an awesome value. All of the extras packaged with the phone are a major plus. The fact that I did not have to renew contracts and plug both AT&T; (work) and T-Mobile (personal) SIM cards and be able to use it on either network is quite priceless.When I opened the box it was a very pleasant surprise on how thin and light this phone is and that is with 4.7" 720p screen. It comes with a newer Android OS 4.2.1 and hopefully will be upgraded soon to a newest 4.2.2 or 4.3. Most of my Android apps work fine with a single exception of Netflix but that is most likely due to the software issues on both the Netflix and the BLU side. Not a big deal and most likely will be resolved soon enough. Everything works just fine. Battery life is very, very good. 2-2.5 days between charges.Wi-Fi performance is quite solid but it only support 2.4 GHz band. Would've been nice to have dual 2.4 GHz and 5.0 GHz support. But than again not a deal breaker since most of the hotspots are 2.4 GHz anyway. Lock on both wireless and Wi-Fi is very good.I would have liked for BLU Products to provide a better support on their webpage. As of right now there is no links to download any documentation nor is there an official software to sync the phone with computer. I had to dig through some 3rd party sites to download the USB drivers and the Sync Manager software for MediaTek based phones.Update - August 7, 2013:- Just received and installed the OTA update that looks like it fixed Netflix issues.

I bought this phone last week and got it within two days ....so far the performance is amazing, great camera, amazing browsing speed. Has a lot space...overall it is awesome so far...

Love this phone since I had for 2 1/2 months but now I have an issue with it.  Now it will not charge getting upset about it. Would have been 4 or 5 stars if it wasn't for this problem. If anyone knows how to resolve this please help.

Excellent design, beautiful, comfortable to use, runs very smooth and the power necessary for day to day use. well system coupled to the two sim cards.negative that I found was that no 3G connectivity runs in the 900 MHz band but not so bad that you can use two sim. besides sporadic small glich in the display. For the price is more than good.

Phone stopped charging.  Also, the phone does not take standard earphones.  I'm disappointed.  I had many hopes for this phone.

At first look and feel the Life Play is a very nice phone,  I was a little unhappy with only 4gigs of internal memroy, but I inserted a 32 gig card and it seemed to be fine.  It does have some slag when operating certain apps. I also find that the GPS stops working and when it does it is not correct..  I have tried several blue tooth devices and they will not pair with the phone which is bad cause i use my phone when I drive and don't like holding a phone in my hand. I also would like to buy a hard case to protect it but there is nothing on the market. Over all if you need a phone that is similar to the Galaxy S3 this is it but it's not as well.

=)Good quality, snappy and responsive, feels durable I'm your hand, comes with screen protector and case. Battery life is great. Works with framaroot for root access.=(Only 4GB for O's 1gb memory so YOU MUST  Install app 2 sd program and microsdhc card. Slows waaay down when using camera.I installed Bravia 2 Engine and some applied some tweaks to the camera and jpgs it saves.So...Looks like a unit that you couldn't do any better on honestly as pointed out memory\storage. Is limited but what do you want for the price. I will by blu again.

Very happy with this phone!!!!  :) after having this phone I won't go back to a iPhone!! very awesome phone

I ordered this phone for my girlfriend after looking thru all the other phone online I thought this phone was the best over all value. I myself have the nexus 4 but side by side the life plays screen is little bigger CPU and ram are pretty equal ROM is low but unlike the nexus 4 this phone has a micro SD slot. So if your looking for a great unlocked android phone this is a prefect choice.So now after one week of use the power connection would only charge if the cable was tilted to the front of the phone. Today after a week and a half phone won't take any charge at all its not the cable either I've tried 4 other chargers.

I've had this phone for quite some time now and I must say that I love it :) The phone has fantastic battery life. This phone regularly last me more than 24 hours. The screen is absolutely gorgeous. Who needs 1080p when you have a 720p screen of this quality? :) I must say that i was pleasantly surprised by how good the camera is. Also, I cannot explain how excited I was to find out this phone has a touch capture option for the camera :) The only problem I've had with this phone is the vibration on a incoming message. Sometimes it vibrates as it should and sometimes it vibrates  incorrectly. Not a big deal though. I think it might be a software issue. I tested a theory I had by installing 2 or 3 third party messaging apps and they always vibrated perfectly when I received a message. So hopefully there will be a software update or something, but it's not that big of a deal. Also, for people looking for accessories, I was able to find a few on eBay. They are for the same phone, just with a different branding on it. (Gionee Elife E3) They fit perfectly :) Overall, this phone is fantastic. Can't beat this performance for such a great price :)Anti-Slid Matte Translucent Case[...]Hard Back Cover[...]Screen Protectors[...]

i recently had a virgin mobile phone for about a year. had to get a new phone cause my vm didn't ring all the time an it was outdated (htc evo 3d). found out about blu life play on youtube. so i decided to get 1. couldn't decide if i wanted at&t;, tmobile, or str8 talk. took it to tmobile. the employee that dealt with me was in shock at the specs for the price. 2 other tmobile emps said it was basically a s4 unlocked for a better $. if blu products next phone is this good, i will buy from them again. which is suppose to be the blu life view. with a 6inch screen an 12mp cam. the galaxy note 2 killer lol. if u do buy this phone get a prepaid tmobile or prepaid att plan. tmobile gives u unlimited everything for $70, att $60 unlimited everything. both no contract. tmobile works better in my area. western PA. cam is good. even does panarama. good screen. very loud ring.**update** on 4/14 phone would not charge at all. Had to tilt charger head forward to catch a charge or angle it a certain way. AMAZON replaced it free.

I bought this phone to replace my pan tech crossover which pretty much just quit the other day, and this phone is a huge upgrade! So, comparing the specs online, its better than the iPhone 5, and runs on par with the s3. This device is fast. Ram is 1gb which is still decent. I had several games and a bunch of things open, and honestly didn't know it until I brought up the running apps. It has been a very pleasant experience. HOWEVER there are several draw backs like every device. First, the screen doesn't light up when you receive a text. In the messaging app, you can't change the colors. Every message in a conversation shows what sim it can from (which is fine, just looks clustered) and the big one is the battery. The life is great, but I powered my phone down last night to charge, and when in woke up, it had the same charge. Once the phone turned on, it immediately started charging, so I'm not sure what's up with that. Overall, its a nice phone, and is worh the money. You'll probably want to add some apps to get certain features such as screen light up with the receiveing of a text message. Its pretty good, and I'll do a YouTube review shortly.UPDATE- in the 15 minutes after writing this review, my battery charged from 50% to 100% so I would say its pretty good!Update- 7/20/2013-It seems impossible to turn data off. Even though its "off" I still get picture messages. Also, I would recommend a battery saver app installed (I use Battery Doctor, works pretty well!) to extend battery life. The phone still feels fast and snappy, and other than some minor quirks which can be fixed with downloading some apps, the phone is really amazing for its price!

I bought this phone because it seemed very good, and it was very cheap compared to the galaxy s4 and the iphone 5.  This phone never fails to amaze me everyday.Battery Life- 5 starsUsage- 4 starsOverall- 5 stars, i definitely recommend this phone

I have purchased 3 of these phones in the space of 6 months and none of them currently work! This phone will fool you when first in hand. It does everything that a Samsung galaxy S4 would but the issue is that it lacks protective gear. One fall and your screen is gone. After 3 months of charging, the charging port wears out and you can't charge the phone anymore.The firs one I bought in August 2013, fell and the LCD got damaged so I just bought a new one. By January. the second one was done! It can't charge anymore... The one I bought for my Husband, the sceen got cracked, it still worked until the charging port wore out. Now I have 3 dead phones..The phone is nice.. but as for durability.. it's a waste of money. Sorry, but this is the truth.BLU products have lost my support. Come hard or stop making cellphones.

This phone is great value for the money. I added a 32 GB microcard, which gives me more than adequate storage. The RAM is only 1GB, and the processor may not be the fastest, but we are talking about a $225 cost. Remember that the iPhone or Samsung S4 will cost you over $600 when you are through paying for it over the length of a contract.I essentially do not use the 3K data network as there is WiFi almost everywhere at home or where I find myself during the day. I use T-mobile, which has a very low price for 1500 min / mo with no contract.Basicaliy, the phone gives me the info I need to have at hand - note this includes syncing data for calendar, contacts, and reminders from my iPad. I would definitely not hesitate to buy this phone again.

within a month after purchasing, the phone stopped charging. Have to be taking out the battery and use a universal charger to chagre it

the phone is great works like an s3, but the camera is not what it promises it 4 stars recommended

That cellphone is so cheap and works very well. It is thin and soft, so it is good to hold it in my pockets. I unique thing I do not like is there is no shortcut to store numbers in the memory, but it is not so fundamental.

Will fall apart and service is extremely unprofessional. It took me months to get my phone back and not only did they fail to fix one problem but with the board they put in, the battery drains twice as fast now and it's not running as well as it was before. Cheap phone that teaches us that we get what we pay for!!I highly recommend spending a bit more money to buy a phone that will actually work. TERRIBLE TO REPAIR A CRAPPY PHONE. Do not buy this!!

I have had many different phones, and this one is comparable at a heck of a lot less of a pricetag. I like the dual sim feature, though it is a bit odd that the sim card slots are two different sizes. All in all I am very happy with my purchase.

I love this phone, it's fast, cheap, and an Android!

Had it for about a week and im very impressed. Its really snappy and responsive, the 4.7 IPS HD screen is great for viewing videos, movies, pictures etc.Great battery life.( got through a whole day with moderate use with about 50% battery left), Speedy processor with little to absolutely no lag, great for graphic intense gaming.(dead trigger, Modern combat 4, Need for speed most wanted, NOVA 3 all run smooth. The camera is decent with a good amount of customization, speaker on this phone is also decent. The fact it has sd storage is great, im On Tmobile and i Get HSPA+ with no problem. for $230 im impressed so far. Update soon

Phone kept shutting off for no reason was great when it worked but would shut down at random times. Many times an hour. Had to return it.

UPDATE after exchanging the L100a for the L100i because Blu told me to:Blu support doesn't know what they're talking about. If you are using AT&T; or T-mobile, you need the L100a. The L100i will only give you pathetic Edge (2G) speed FOREVER. It doesn't have the correct frequencies. Also, unless your metro area has been completely re-farmed for T-mobile, you will be very unhappy with any Blu Life Play on T-mobile. I live in Denver and some parts of the city have been upgraded but not my side of town. This might be a great phone is 6 months, but I can't wait that long to check my email outside of my house.UPDATE to my original review last week -- The following quote from Blu support is wrong info directly from the manufacturer:"Thank you for contacting BLU Products. It is our pleasure to serve you. It seems you have the Life Play L100a. For all of our devices, if the model number ends in the letter a it is compatible with the 850/1900 3G/4G frequency (AT&T;) and if the model number ends in the letter I it is compatible with the 850/2100 3G/4G frequency (T-Mobile). For example, the L100a works better for AT&T; than the L100i, which would be for T-Mobile. Please contact your seller for an exchange for the same model ending in an i as that is the correct model you need.Also, our devices only have support for HSDPA (regular 4G) not LTE.  Should you have any additional questions please contact us, via E-Mail or 1-877-602-8762.  [...]* * *After I complained again to Blu about Edge speeds when I got the second phone, they sent me an email on how to config the phone by changing the APN. Again, they were wrong because T-mobile told me the L100i does not support their 3G/4G frequencies. ARGH!!The moral of the story = DO NOT BUY AN L100i for USA use.  Call a local Tmobile with the frequency specs on any unlocked phone you're considering before purchasing. It will save you many headaches. My head hurts a lot right now.

I LOVE MY PHONE I USE IT IN VENEZUELA AND IT WORK PERFECTLY WHIT ALL CARRIER HERE. IT`S AN EXCELLENT PHONE FOR A VERY GOOD PRICE

This phone is amazing, I would recommend anyone to buy this who has AT and T or Tmobile. It has a beautiful screen at 720p. The price on this is unbeatable for what you get, charger, case, screen protector. The only real issue is the small amount of storage but there is an SD card slot.

I've only had this phone for a few days, but I really like it.  It's a very nice looking phone, lightweight, and a clear bright screen. In addition to the usual charger, data cable, and headphones, it came boxed with a screen protector and silicone case.  I really love the choice of colors and the price was acceptable.I purchased this when my Samsung Galaxy Skyrocket started freezing several times a day, after only a year. Samsung is my brand of choice, so to go with an unknown brand called BLU was a real gamble.My only problem with the phone had to do with being unable to access my AT&T; data package when WiFi was unavailable. Two lengthy calls to ATT's tech support and a visit to the store were not helpful. The store staff said they had never heard of BLU and suggested that I needed to return the phone to Amazon.My last resort was to search online to see if others had the same issue. I found several postings that provided the APN settings for my service provider. I tried them and WOW!! I'm now up and running. So now, the wait to see how things go with my pink BLU Life Play has begun.  I'll update this review as needed, but for now I'm giving it four stars.Update 8/20/13--- Discovered that pictures sent via email wouldn't download.  Did another search online and found others who provided settings that worked! Callers notified me that my voice mail was not personalized. Will try to find a solution and report back.  Even with these issues I still like this phone.Update 9/29/13--- I still like this phone and it is working fine. I figured out how to record my personal voice mail greeting since my last update. My only complaint right now is that the WLAN does not automatically stay on.Update 1/24/14--- I still like the phone but a little less. The internal phone storage is small and will not accommodate many of my apps. Although I have a nice sized SD card, the phone requires many of my apps to be stored internally and will not go on the SD card. When my apps are updated, I constantly get an insufficient storage space message. Setting the phone to automatically download to the SD card won't work.Perhaps all phones have this issue, so my 4 star rating remains. The BLU tech people were very helpful in explaining my problem.I may need to consider another phone when time for my AT&T; upgrade, but this will make me unhappy. I think the BLU phones are a great alternative to the pricier name brand phones.Update 2/18/14--- Having MAJOR problems with the updating of apps. The phone prompts me that my apps need to be updated.  When I click on update, I keep getting error messages saying there is insufficient space on the device for each application. The majority of these apps are actually on the 32 SD card, so I'm not sure what is happening. For those apps I really want to be updated, I end up deleting other apps to try to clear space.It's become a nuisance, so when my AT&T; upgrade is available in the next couple of months, I will be getting a different phone. I am disappointed because I really loved this phone. Perhaps it's just my particular phone or me. I still think this is a good buy for someone who does not use this phone as their lifeline or need a lot of applications.  For the reason stated above, I have lowered my rating to three stars.

I bought this phone on 09/04/13 and after much research I decided to shoot the gun and purchase it. The price is amazing, I was extremely satisfied with the phone while it worked.  No lag, sd card support, nice large screen. However,just today the charging port died.  Like the other reviewers, the phone won't charge unless the wire is held a certain way.  This is unacceptable for a phone that is less than a month old.Overall, it was a really good phone while everything was functioning properly but there needs to be more quality control on these phone.  Glad I tried out Blu but I will be wary of the future phones from them.  I am returning this to Amazon and most likely look at other US android phones.

this phone has it all 8 mp camera back, 2 mp front, quad core procesor, 1 gb ram, android 4.2, great screen quality and very responsibe. this phone is worth it for the price plus you don;t have to be attach to just a single carrier since the phone is unlocked you can use any provider that uses a sim card mini or regular. am very happy with this product. battery life is great it lasts the whole day and am a heavy game and app user. the only thing that this company can improve is the speaker and the flash light but anything else its great!!!!!

it came today, so far i'm enjoying, great headphones and cover!!! i will buy another for my girl. great phone!

THIS PHONE WORKS GOOD BUT SOME TIMES THE APPS ARE NOT WORKING PROPERLY AFTER YOU DOWNLOAD SOME OTHER APPS YOU HAVE TO RESET IT AGAIN TOTHE FACTORY WELL FOR THE PRICE YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR HALF OF THE OTHER COMPETITOR.

Android Jelly Bean version works well with this phone! Great features in a slim design. Exactly the size I wanted, not a gigantic screen with ergonomic design. Great accessories come in the box: high quality earphones, screen protector and transparent non-slip rubber protective case. However earphones tend to fall off when working out. I made a mistake of applying the screen protector after smudging the screen playing with the phone. Though I am not so sure of the reliability. I've only had this phone for less than a month and the USB port is already acting up when charging. Hoping the seller will help with limited warranty. I would recommend still this phone for the value!

I've had this phone for about a month now. I was super excited to get it, but also very cautious due to the percentage of people who had complaints about it. As a result of this, I did some EXTENSIVE research on youtube, blogs and other sites, to see if other people have experienced issues with this device. To my surprise, most complaints came straight out of Amazon. Currently, I love this phone. I use only 1 Sim slot, and I consider myself a power user. Fortunately, even with using the camera, instant message apps, gaming for at least 2 hours a day and hours upon hours of music, the battery has NEVER drained on me. I did, however, run into a few issues with it. I'm going to explain what those issues are, and how I resolved it.First, allow me to say that BLU's technical support is horrendous. And I know they read the reviews on this site, so BLU. you really need to step up or this explosion of popularity that you have will quickly dwindle.-The dreaded MicroUSB Cord: DO NOT USE IT! When I pulled out the cord for the first time to charge the phone, I noticed that the end that goes into the phone was surprisingly longer than average. After the charge was complete, I found myself applying way too much effort to disconnect it. So much pulling can't be good. After that point, I decided to use a regular microUSB cable instead. I believe repetitive use of the original cord on the Blu Life Play will cause damage to the USB port. So please DO NOT use it.-Random Restarts/Screen Flickering: I had those problems too. Tech Support suggested that I speak to amazon about replacing the phone because it may be &#34;defective&#34;. I refused to do that, as I currently reside overseas. I read on a forum somewhere that other has this exact problem, and that a factory reset solved it. It was a bit annoying to have to re-install all my apps, but it was worth it. So if you have this problem, just do a factory reset. NOTE: an app like App List Backup can really come in handy if you can't remember all your apps.These were the main issues that I had with this device. I noticed that I don't have &#34;gesture typing&#34; like it claims it does, or &#34;photo sphere&#34; but I simply got apps to take care of that. Other than that, this is a great phone for the price. Like I said, its been a month, and hopefully I've seen the end of my troubles with it. Before you call tech support and get disappointed like I was, do some troubleshooting yourself and please remember, it's plastic - meaning it will break if you're too rough.

For all you people out there that buy phones that say they are &#34;unlocked&#34; and will work on any network, DO NOT  believe it! This phone said it was capable with any network, but then I finally get it (9 days late) and take it to the Verizon store, only to find out that I have completely wasted my time and my money! It only works with AT&T, and T-Mobile, both of which suck for many reasons!

The phone works perfectly. Not have any error, fast, efficient, no crashes. I highly recommend it. The only thing is that it should improve 8megapixels really, because it seems one of 6megapixels.

I liked this phone a lot. But I have only had it four months and the charger port broke so now I cannot use my phone.

The product itself is reasonable, but after two months of use the USB connector failed. More importantly, the repair department refused to ship internationally to Australia, claiming they had previous issues with custom fees they had to pay for. To me this is a cop out: shipping international and making sure recipient pays duties and customs is a no brainer on a Fedex envelope. The service reps were cordial and as pleasant as they could, but really the international service is not to par. They need to be creative with their approach and more flexible. If planning to take this phone international, think twice. I would not recommend it. Too poor a service.

Perfect for an average user, and feels good when held. I find its quick and responsive, and takes out good photos to share with friends and family.

So glad i got this phone. it works very well i have straight talk.I really like the video wall paper.

Very good phone would recommend it. Like the built in apps. Would be a five if screen didn't dim slit.

$230 is a pretty darn good price for this phone which includes a case and screen protector.Pros:- Bright and clear 1280x720 IPS LCD. Great viewing angles with sharp text.- Good 8MP camera. I compared pictures taken with the Life Play and my Galaxy S 2 (IMO great camera picture quality) and found them to be comparable. The 1080 video recording look pretty good as well. No lag or stutter.- The speaker and earpiece were loud enough for me. Phone call quality (this is a phone afterall right?) was good.- Decent battery life. As with most modern smartphones you'll want to charge it halfway through the day.- The MTK MT6589 chipset is powerful enough to play some 720P MKVs containing H.264 video and DTS audio played back through MXPlayer using software decoding. I'm not a big gamer on cell phones but I did load up Dead Space. Extremely smooth gameplay.- MicroSD slot.- Dual SIM: One is a micro-SIM and the other is a regular SIM slot. I only used one SIM.- WiFi and Bluetooth radios worked without a hitch. Phone has support for HSDPA 850/1900 which is perfect for AT&T;, AT&T; MVNO customers, and some T-Mobile customers depending on location. Supposedly supports 42Mbps downloads and 21 Mbps uploads but I couldn't really verify that since I'm running on a AT&T; MVNO.- GPS locks quickly and stays locked. Good accuracy according to GPS Test app.- Phone is VERY thin and light.- Almost stock Android 4.2.1.Cons:- Only 4GB of storage of which 1.75GB is user accessible. Keeps prices down I suppose.- USB and audio ports on top of phone. I prefer my USB ports on the bottom but this is probably just user preference. At least the USB port isn't on the side of the phone.- No HDMI out support.- The battery cover seems to pop off pretty easily. Removing the TPU case from the phone can easily pop the battery cover off. Not a big deal if you don't remove the TPU case often.- Lack of accessories. Come on BLU. I want an extra battery.Overall I'd recommend this phone for budget conscious users who don't want to pay a fortune for unlocked un-subsidized smartphones. I fall into that category and my primary needs for smartphones are: Big screen but not Galaxy Note sized, good GPS, good camera, and good PHONE performance. This phone fits those needs.*** 7/7/2013 Update ***+ Camera: Not so great in low light and the flash is useless. The flash actually causes a glare and drowns out my subject in the photo. On the bright side the camera has an HDR setting which works very well!+ Wireless Display: Found a toggle for Wireless Display. It's obviously not an Intel WiDi device... maybe Miracast? Will test with a Netgear PTV3000.+ Battery life: For a 4.7" screen device, this phone lasts longer than my Samsung Galaxy S 2 i777 and Galaxy Nexus. Maybe it's the combination of newer low power chipsets and an 1800mAh but it definitely lasts longer and actually charges while the screen and GPS chipset is in use in the car.+ MicroSDHC slot: I couldn't get my SanDisk 64GB microsdxc to function properly. The phone recognized the exFAT formatted card as a damaged card and suggested a reformat. It did so but stopped recognizing the card after I copied somewhere over 1.5GB but less than 2GB back to the card. The card works fine in my Win8 tablet.*** 7/31/2013 Update ***Never able to test out the Wireless Display function as the Netgear PVT1000 I had access to only supports Intel WiDi. Oh well.I did manage to get an AT&T; GoPhone SIM and cut it down to microSIM size for use in the SIM 1 slot. Both SIMs are active but only one can use 3G (HSPA+). The OS allows you to choose which one uses 3G and you can also choose the default SIM for voice, data, text, and video calls. Pretty cool feature since I've never used a dual active SIM phone before.For those looking for extra screen protectors and batteries: This phone is essentially a re-badged Gionee Elife E3. I purchased some screen protectors and a battery for that model and they work on the BLU Life Play. It's a shame BLU hasn't addressed our accessory needs yet.Overall I'm very pleased with this phone and still amazed it only costs $230 unlocked. As component prices come down, I hope to see HDMI out and OTG support for next year's iteration.

When I received it it seems the box was opened before (the seal was broken from both side ) - and the phone looks like it was used before - it has some scratches on the cover. When I turned it on it restarted couple of time- even when I tried to turn it off it turned on  automatically.

Absolutely love it!!!!! I was hesitated at first but Wow!!!! Worth every penny

I'm from Venezuela and the phone works perfectly and is comparable to the S3 practically the same phone ... Excellent product I recommend ..

Have uses dual Sim phones for past six years and nice h/w and s/w on blu phone.  I like this phone with access to battery, Sim cards, and memory with back cover removed.  T-Mobile will mail free micro to replace standard Sim rather than pay 20 bucks at dealer. This phone uses one micro and one standard Sim card.

Well it is my second day of using the phone. My thoughts as of now. The phone is amazing. Battery life is very good. the look of the phone is sleek, the features are awesome, the apps great, take pictures excellent, volume is loud wont miss any calls, I like the features, very user friendly, internet is very fast. There is more that I could say. Buy it. you wont regret it.This was a very good buy for me.

Awesome android phone at a great price. Works just as great as the quattro 4.5 HD but without all the problems. Blue did a really great job with this phone. If you are looking for a reasonable android phone with great features then look no more.

I bought this very shortly after it was released, and I love it. It's a great phone and works really well. The only downside is I found a spot in the middle of my screen that is too bright. a spot of about a square millimeter or half mm, the pixels are too bright, and fades into the normal ones. since it is smack dab in the center of the screen, it irks me to no end. I've been very careful with the phone so I don't know what could have happened to it. other than that, great phone

I have had the phone for several months now and it's great. Is it as good or better than the Galaxy S3 I had? No. Will you be happy if you're the person who needs to have an app for every little thing imaginable? No. Is 3G as fast as 4G LTE? No. BUT, if you need a smart phone for Google maps, email, texting and watching a few videos on your lunch hour, it's great. Best of all, if you have a phone for business and a personal line you can have 2 SIM cards in this phone. I don't know any branded phone that can do that.There are a couple of design omissions though. There is no light that flashes when you have received a message or missed a phone call like the Samsung. The camera only operates through the touch screen, you can't use the buttons for functions. With that said though the camera is great. Also, oddly enough the earbuds that came with phone are the best I have ever heard!In summary, if you are a heavy app/data user who needs to download and watch HD movies while you sit on the subway tweeting every little detail of you ride, it's not for you. If you need a good phone, don't like 2 year contracts and need 2 numbers in one phone, it's great.

For what reason spend money in a spensive phone....... if this phone know how to rock...Great  Picture, Video, Sound. Big Screen.Realy i love...

it works for me. i went to str8 talk service and needed a phone. this technical guru friend of mine put me on this phone and brand. i was very impressed by it. compares to the galaxy 3 without the price tag

It met my expectations, greetings from Venezuela .. Thank you very much! More rapidly in fresh Thank you very much!

Absolutely stunning I got the sky blue one,  my 9 year old was with me when I opened it he flipped out!  He said whoa that's cool I want one. (he has an iphone) So I popped in my solavei sim card and bam, didn't have to do any thing else... The Internet worked immediately and let me tell you its blazing fast I got download speeds around  7000 on a speed test app it came with an awesome jelly blue case and a screen protector I can't wait for the blu life one to hit the shelves I'm buying it then I'll let my son have this one GREAT JOB BLU,, It was  WELL WORTH THE WAIT

The phone works great if it works. Mine worked for 1 month before it refused to take a charge and became completely inert. I contacted Blu's Tech Support and was surprised to receive a quick reply and request for specific information about the phone which I've included below. After sending the requested information in reply I received essentially the same automated request again. It has been nearly two weeks and the automated reply is the only reply I receive. Calling the number provided gets you a recorded statement repeated in a loop (I gave up after 90 minutes).  I ordered a replacement battery from Amazon so we'll see if its just the battery or the phone is a brick. If you want a $200 smart phone, I would recommend buying a used iPhone or Galaxy. This phone is not reliable and the company is even less so.Hello,Thank you for contacting BLU Products. We would be happy to help!  This is a known issue, we will need to perform a warranty claim.In order for us to further assist you, please reply with the following:Full name (example: John Doe):Email address:IMEI number for the phone (located under battery or on box):Model of the device and color:Part Number (located under battery or on box):Attach a copy of printed invoice/receipt(written receipts or order confirmations are  not valid):Place where you bought the device:Where are you located (address please):A brief description on the issue that you are having:(If possible) A picture of  your device with the issue you are describing:What would be the best contact phone number for us to reach you?After we check your device, we will contact you if in any case it is not covered by the warranty.If you cannot provide the invoice/receipt/proof of purchase, please contact your seller in order for us to work on your device under warranty.Should you have any additional questions please contact us, via E-Mail or 1-877-602-8762 (Monday-Friday 9:30am-5:30pm EST).Thank you for choosing BLU!

Just got it and popped in my Straighttalk Sim. Great screen very vibrant colors. Great look and feel and unreal price. I would recommend this phone to anyone. I recently tried the nexus 4 and loved it but the volume from the auxiliary port made using it connected to my car stereo Impossible. The Life Play however, works great. The phone came with a tpu case, screen protector and a very nice pair of headphones. This phone is replacing my iPhone 5 and I had to try a few different phones To find the right one. The Life Play is the first one to make me feel comfortable enough to let go of my iPhone. Coupled with Straighttalk you can't beat it. The look of this phone is really a surprise. It's thinner than my iPhone 5 but the screen is bigger. Still, the phone unlike a galaxy or HTC is easy to use one handed. The CPU seems smoothe and I've noticed no lag. In my humble opinion this phone is easily on par with the nexus 4 or better and I'd say a very slight step behind the iPhone 5. I only say that because I prefer IOS to android but the phone itself is truly a pleasure.

I have always had an AT&T; GoPhone and recently I wanted to upgrade.  Since the phone I had for the last two years was similar to the Avail 2, the next step up would have been AT&T;'s Galaxy Express.  Being a college student, $250 (not including taxes) for a phone is a lot of money, and since AT&T; hardly ever has sales, I began searching for other options and stumbled upon the BLU company.  I spent about a week looking up customer reviews on the internet and YouTube and decided to give it a try.I purchased the BLU Life Play in Pink, on sale for $217 (no taxes/taxes included? and free shipping).Let me tell you, I went from having a semi-smart phone to being completely upgraded to this century's technology in just a matter of minutes!  All I had to do was just insert my micro-sim card into the slot and it worked perfectly.  No internet connection problems, fast lightning speeds, downloads apps in seconds.  I really love this phone!The phone is great for Instagram (the 8PM camera on the phone is divine), Twitter, and texting.  The calls are also clear and people on the other end have no problems hearing me.  (It might have just been the age of the phone but I have a friend who is a Verizon customer and he claims to have issues hearing people who have AT&T; services and phones.  With the BLU phone, there have been no issues at all so far.)The BLU Life Play is surprisingly thin and light, and is about an inch longer than a box of soap or a pack of cigarettes.  The phone also comes with headphones that match the color of the phone, a soft-ish, opaque protective back cover that matches the color of the phone as well, and a wall charger that also converts into a USB port for the computer.  I was surprised about the headphones, I didn't know that they came with the phone, which was a nice surprise when I opened the box.I am very satisfied with my purchase and would definitely recommend this to all who are looking for an up-to-date phone without the huge price tag.

I USE THE PHONE A WEEK, THEN STOPPED RUNNING THE SIM CARD SEE CODES AND DISAPPEARED imeis, SEND AN EMAIL TO TECHNICAL SUPPORT AND COULD NOT SOLVE PROBLEM, OTHER WEEK AFTER THE TELEPHONE AND SHUT OFF WHEN I power BECOMES VERY HOT AND I HAVE TO SHUT DOWN AGAIN.

OMG that phone is the best one can buy at an affordable price.  it is very responsive and makes life a lot easier.  couldn't' ask for a better hand set.  in addition it is extremely thin.  Bravo to BLU.

For the first couple days they worked great after that the problems started. Kept shutting off even when fully charged half the time didn't make it to home screen only boot screen. I will not get this phone again. I sent it back although a good working phone for a couple days I did not like it once I got it.

OMG!!!!!!! This phone is AMAZING. Its fast, bright colors inside and out, the camera (front & back) is just beautiful,  when i play my music using the headphones that were provided on the phone it sounds beatiful and you can adjust how you want your music to sound, the apps work perfect ( to me) and is totally worth paying. At this price how could you not buy this phone. Also it comes with a pair of headphones , a screen protector, and a gel case. So what are you waiting for go buy a BLU LIFE PLAY phone now.P.s. I have it in BLUe :))))))

The phone is very pleasant and did not get any annoying bugs after 2 months.Pro-The screen is clear and responsive.Very light and thin phone, come with rubber protection.Hardware feature work well (mini usb, headphone plug, buttons, microphone, speaker)Bluetooth connect very fast with my device (logitech headphone, kinivo headphone)Wifi connect and transfer speed is fastGPS trigger instant and track really quick (accuracy 100 meter)Mobile phone is strong and connect far outside city range.(T-mobile, and Rogers)Easy to install application, and update available regularly.Recharge quick and the battery last for a day or more (depend on usage)Android 4.2 is better and stable than previous version (I see a difference even from 4.1)Camera is high quality (but no option to reduce glare from street light at night)Audio music dynamic is good. (apps should offer option to play last upload music)Con-The only outpoint is micro sim and mini sim (I wish it offer 2 mini sim)I could not usb the phone direct to computer, I had to install &#34;Airdroid&#34;Phone book do not offer address entry (I got to create gmail account, then its possible to have address input)Digital keyboard is narrow for texting.. got to rotate screen to have larger keyboard, still not precise as the iphone and samsungI call tech support regarding initiate sim in Canada, and customer service was prompt, polite, patient and good.BLU is a promising company!

Good battery life, faster than Samsung devises, good for rough use as well. I will recommend to every one and i have already

I bought one for my wife and one for myself. I use mine with Tmobile (3G) and H2oWireless (2G). My wife uses her's with H2oWireless. Both phones work great.

I bought this phone to replace a broken phone.  However things only work until you have to reboot your phone.  Every reboot on the phone disconnected all my connected account.  I would have to go back into each service to reconnect the account.

I love this phone. It's super fast very light. I love the slim built of the phone. I would recommend this product

I didn't want to spend a ton to buy my girlfriend a new phone and she was gonna have to pay like a $600 deductible which is moronic.  This thing works about as fast as my Galaxy S3, the picture quality isn't as good as some of the high end phones, but if you are going from a flip phone or a year or 2 old smartphone, this thing is WAY better than most of the phones out there at a MUCH lower price, I am 1000000000000000% pleased, you will be too, trust me.  It worked with her TMOBILE service, just switched the sim cards and put in her google account info and everything synced up fine.......phone is GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Very good phone. U just have to add extra memory to it because its very limited on space but that's not a major problem for me.  And the price is right. Love it

Let me tell you.. You cant go wrong with this phone for the price !!The only negative is that they dont sell protective cases for it ... that's why it gets only a 4 star..

I don't think this phone is for power users: I think it's for the rest of us who want a recent android os and decent core capabilities. After less than six weeks of use, the USB cable receptacle failed to provide a connection....on a Saturday.  Stuff Happens! I was surprised to find how much I now rely on a stupid cell phone! So I bought another one and sent the first one back to the seller for replacement. I like the idea of having identical primary and a back-up phones...two full-function phones cheaper than the cost of an iPhone 5C or one of the top android models. And the extra phone can back up my wife's phone as well.

At first I thought this phone was going to be alright. Within a few days though I'd go to use it and it'd be turned off. It wouldn't turn back on unless I first removed the battery. This began happening with more and more frequency. Then begins the phone dropping calls, spontaneously freezing, and just now froze midring and would not stop ringing until the battery was removed. Multiple reboots and battery removals are sometimes required for me to make an outgoing call. I'm sending this back. Ridiculous.

BUT IT DOES NOT WORK WELL WITH OTHER HEADPHONES SOMETIMES IT DOES !!!!!!! So make sure  you don't loose them

Purchased the BLU Life Play in February and had it for about 2 months. I use Straight Talk with an AT&T; sim with no problems with service in my area (Nortwest US)  This is an Excellent phone.  Lightweight, low-profile, fast, amazing display, great sound quality, and more.  The 4 gigs on board gets eaten up quickly with updates from apps, but just move as much as you can onto a SD card is there should be no issues.The only other thing that is hard is finding a case, but some are starting to come online now with hopefully more soon.About a month ago, my charging port starting going kaput and I called up BLU via their external website.  The guy in the RMA department was super friendly and quickly responded with all the information they needed to see if the phone fell under warranty.  I followed all their directions (make sure you keep your paper receipt that ships with the phone!!!) and shipped the phone to their facility in FL.  Well, after diligent emails from the RMA dept folks keeping me updated on my phones status, not even two weeks had passed and they already have things buttoned up.  But what is amazing is they personally called me to discuss options about what I could do with my phone and I was just blown away in the best way.  What a great company and great service from the RMA deparment!!!If you are looking for a really well-rounded unlocked GSM phone, any of these BLU phones will do, especially the Life Play series.  You will not be disappointed!!

Picture quality is great, very responsive and fast.....but after 2 weeks of having it, the device would not charge. I was able to return it and was sent a replacement at no extra charge and the same thing happened again. Eventually i gave up and got my money back.

the nearly 5&#34; screen is awsome for the price. the 4g is pretty fast once u get a good 4g tower close by .if it runs facebook smooth you know it works . nice pics

Large, impressive screen. Snappy performance. Free gel case. Micro-SD card slot (major !) Thin and light. Almost too thin and light actually - makes the side mounted switches thin and sometimes uncomfortable to press. Powerful operating system. Dual SIM. Lovely back camera - excellent video even  in relatively poor light from a tiny hole and a tiny sensor. Go technology!Not sure how the all-plastic construction will hold up over time - get a case. Beware ! SIM #1 is the micro-SIM and SIM#2 only supports 2G. Make sure and put your primary phone number withe the data plan in SIM#1 slot.Only 1GB memory ! At 2GB Android devices fly with little or no limitations. If you're an active app user, at 1GB, they fly until you reach the memory limit, then everything starts to crumble (&#34;Storage space running out - Some system functions may not work&#34;). From the start, buy a 32GB or 64 GB micro SD card and set the phone to install apps and store data on the card. But this is only a partial solution - these devices need more processor-accessible RAM !Phone doesn't let me log into my portable mi-fi unit - still checking why.Given the prices of the Samsung, HTC, Apple type devices, it's absolutely amazing that this kind of capability is available, unlocked, at these prices. Go BLU !

Well what can I say, this has been a great phone so far.  The screen is very beautiful and bright, the colors are vivid and the viewing angles are awesome.  The phone overall feels solid in the hand, well worth the 200 bucks.  The battery life is very good for me, I can get over a day of use out of this phone with no charging. I play games for about an hour, make a few phone calls and browse the net, my on screen time so far averages about 2-2.5 hours a day, and I have about 55% left at the end. The sound quality from the rear speaker is good as well as from the ear speaker (sounds the same as my galaxy S4).  The included headset has great sound and bass (I wish they would have came with smaller earbuds, but hey, they were free!).  The vibration is solid, it doesn't feel cheap like I've had in other inexpensive devices.While doing a speedtest I was able to get 9.33mb down and 2.60mb up, I was about 1/4mile away from the nearest cell tower I could see, this is with net10 At&t; hspa+.  The further away I drove I would get less speed, but I averaged about 4-5mbs down, and 1.5mbs up.At home with wifi I pulled down 28mbs, and 3.8mbs up, on average from my router that was about two rooms away (35ft).  It is a 30mbs connection.The free case and screen protector is a bonus. I found extra cases and screen protectors online under a different phone name, the Gionee Elife E3, this phone also goes by other names in different markets, but I've forgot them.I've read a ton of reviews on this phone, and most people complain about things that do not have anything to do with the phone at all! lolThey may complain about not having the SMS or what not, but they for got this is an unlocked phone and you have to set up the APN with the correct information!All in All, I think I made a good purchase with the blu life play, it's a very good phone so far.  I own a galaxy S4 but I cracked the screen and this is my replacement, I don't regret it one bit.  Other than the extra gimmicky stuff and the screen size that the S4 has, I think this phone is on par with it.  I probably will be trying out the Blu Life One, when the price comes down a little.

This phone amazed me, for a $200 prize range it has good performance compared to other brands put there. It has a big screen and a decent camera to go with it.

This phone was an upgrade from a Nokia E5 smartphone. I received the phone on 01/06/2014. I was hesitant to make the leap to an android phone since I am usually several years behind in technology. However, when I discovered this phone and found that it was unlocked, dual sims, and just over $200 I took the plunge and I am so happy that I did.Unlike my old smartphone, I can watch YouTube videos, check emails, play games, and can acutally view certain websites that my old phone just couldn't handle. I know that some reviews have given the phone negative remarks because of the internal memory but I was able to buy a 64 GB sd card and after I formatted the card with my phone, it works great so I can't really take away on the memory. Some phones that I found were not able to be expanded so this was a great feature.I don't notice any lagging with playing games but I have noticed that it does get a little hot after I have used it non stop for a couple of hours. I charge the battery right before I go to bed and it tends to hold the charge all day unless I sit and play games for hours and then I need to charge it twice a day.  It took me a while to get used to a touch screen and a keypad but after using this a month, I don't know how I survived without it.The call quality is great and I live in a rural area.  I have Straight Talk on the AT&T; network and so I pay $45 month for this phone. It took me a long time to find the APN settings that worked with this phone and I will include them at the end of my post. The headset that came with this phone sound great when I am listening to the radio and I have not tried a different set on the phone so I can't comment on the other reviews that said some headsets don't work with this phone.Okay, so the one bad thing I can say about this phone is that on 02/06/2014 I had my phone charging (or so I thought) and when I got up the next morning my phone was dead! I tried 4 different chargers and nothing would charge it. I went to work and googled and found that some other people had problems with the charging port. I was very disappointed because I had the phone exactly 30 days and now it wasn't working. I called Amazon and they shipped me out a new phone which I received today and this saved a star on my review. While waiting on the new phone to arrive a co-worker was able to get the original charger to work but only if you held the charger a certain way and if you tried to lay it down to finish charging it would stop which leads me to believe that the charging port was loose. I found a post that said the original charger that comes with the phone is probably the cause of the problem since it is designed to be very snug and you have to pull harder than normal to get the charger to release from the port. I have decided not to use the original charger that came with the new phone and I am hopeful that I won't have this problem again. So aside from the charging issue, this phone is a great deal and can be used on Straight Talk which is also a great deal.For the APN Settings. I found several posts that kept giving the following settingsName: STRAIGHT TALK (or just any name you would like to use)APN: tfdataProxy: proxy.mvno.tracfone.comPort: &lt;Leave in Blank>Username: &lt;Leave in Blank>Password: &lt;Leave in Blank>Server: &lt;Leave in Blank>MMSC: [...]MMS proxy: mms3.tracfone.comMMS port: 80MCC: 310MNC: 410Authentication type: &lt;Leave in Blank>APN type: default,supl,mmsAPN Protocol: Leave it to the Default oneHowever, I also found an obscure posting that said the above settings were for newer phones and that older phone models should use the below settings. Since this model was originally released around March of 2013, I used the old apn settings listed below and my phone came to life and I can text, send pics, make calls, and surf the internet. The below setting is what I used on the phone that was shipped back to Amazon and the phone that I received today so I believe they are correct for any Blu Life Play model. Hope this helps.Name: Straight talk (or anything you want)APN: att.mvnoAPN Type: default, mms, suplProxy: Not SetPort: 80Username: Not SetPassword: Not SetServer: Not SetMMSC: [...]MMS proxy: 66.209.11.33MMS port: 80MCC: 310MNC: 410Authentication type: Not SetAPN protocol: IPv4APN roaming protocol: IPv4APN enabledBearer: UnspecifiedOverall I am very satisfied with this phone and it makes me feel like I have a modern phone without having to shell out the modern price to go with it.  I will update this review in 30 days to update on how the charging port is working on the new phone.UPDATE: 06/05/2014. I gave it more than 30 days to post my update becaue I really wanted to test out the charging issue that I was having. I have not used the original charging cord that came with the phone; however, I have experienced an issue with other charging cords not wanting to charge my phone unless I am holding it a certain way. I had to replace my car charger and bought a $20 one from Wal-Mart and the cord that came with the charger was a little different than all of the other cords that I have used over the years.  What I found was that my phone really loves this cord. I can use this cord and it will charge no matter what position my phone is in or how it is lying AND it charges SOOOOOO much faster than with any other cord. My only theory as to why this cord works better than any other one is because of its design and how snug it is in the port. Although it is snug, you do not have to pull hard on the cord to get it out of the port so it does't damage the port either. I took my rating down to a 4 star rating because the charging port seems to have issues with the majority of cords avaialble and I only lucked out and found one that it likes.  I have never had this type of issue with any other phone so I feel that this should be looked at by the manufacturer.  All other features are still working great and I am still happy with my phone (even with the charging issues).

It was a great phone when it arrived. However, within two weeks it started having charging problems. Had to wiggle the cord to get it to charge. Now, at four weeks it won't charge. Have tried multiple cords. I wish I had read more of the reviews. This seems to happen to a lot of their customers. I am on day two of waiting to hear back from them. So far just automail. This is annoying.

Great phone, unbeatable price, gorgeous display, it has an sd card slot, capability for two sim cards, and an amazing managing for two cellphone carriers. It comes with an display cover, a tpu cellphone case, good stereo headset and the usb charger. Everything right from the box for one big low. price, i would advice this cellphone for everyone.Gran tel&eacute;fono, se lo recomiendo a todo el mundo. Posee una hermosa pantalla de gran resolusi&oacute;n y muy sensible, es super delgado y liviano, trae excelentes aud&iacute;fonos, un protector para la pantalla, un estuche de gel para el celular y el cargador con su respectivo cable usb. El precio es imbatible, econ&oacute;mico y maneja de manera excelente dos operadores de telefon&iacute;a con su capacidad de doble sim card.

this phone everything i hoped and more! got a sim phone from straight talk for 7 bucks and now am in buisness. plays netflix and hulu movies  nicely if you can get h or h+ signal where you are, which is like 3g or 3.5g, something like that.. battery charge holds up nicely, even when watching media on it. i reccomend it to anyone with a limited budget and especially if you are a straight talk user who is not happy with the phones they offer

I bought this life play as it is comparable to the Samsung SIII.  It is very slim and looks nice and well worth the money.  Only 4GB is too small internal storage which after OS only leaves less than 2GB.  I also did hit a couple problems the first being the sd card slot is not spring-lock like most phones but instead a slide in like some sim slots.  This is not as secure for a mounted device.  The first time i dropped it a few inches the jolt disrupted the connection and corrupted the sd card requiring a reformat and complete loss of data.  Second problem was when putting on the screen protector there were lots of bubbles i could not get out.  turns out under the advertising label which left glue behind  there already was a screen protector on the phone which i did not know.  i bought two phones and both were like this.  unfortunately all four screen protectors were ruined and the company response was i needed to buy some more if i could find them somewhere.

It is an OK phone. internet access is good. CPU is fine, it is very thine, battery life is good.The bad parts:Bluetooth does a bad job with my car Nokia Bluetooth speaker. once there is a call - the radio is disconnected until I turn the Bluetooth down. it is very annoying while driving. I tried communicating wit customer support, and they told me this is that way it works.GPS is not very reliable.I would have rather put some more money, and buy a Nexus or some older Samsung 3

I purchased this phone less than 2 months ago. The phone was working great, but 1 week ago, the charging port started giving problems. It will only charge if the cord is wiggled and held in a specific position. I tried using 3 different chargers and cords, they work on another phone which I have had for 3 years, but not on the Life Play that is less than 2 months old.I have emailed Blu several times, but apart from a generic auto reply, did not hear back from them. No one picks up their phone when called.So basically I paid $230 for an expensive paperweight!BUYERS BEWARE!! It is better to spend a little more and get a phone from a brand with a solid customer support.

I was very impressed with this phone compared to other phones as it had great specs. The only problem I had was with the head phone jack. Everytime I tried using a (bought several) head set it sounded very bad.Now less than five moths later I cannot use it. It will not charge. I noticed at first was that because the charging port is on top the charger does not stay in good. It always seemed to stick out a little. Now no matter what charger I use I cannot charge the phone.  Tried to contact Blu (the company) cannot get a live person. Went to the website for technical support, they sent an automatic reply asking for the same info I gave the first time with a receipt. Then I send the info and get the same Reply back. If I can not get it fix I will have to buy a new phone soon because I travel for work and Graduate school. Suffice it to say I will not be buying Blu if I cannot get in touch with them or get some kind of response. Other reviewers say they thought Blu customer service was good, maybe they are having an 'off week'?-update I did hear from blu after a couple day of back and fourth. My phone was sent out and "fixed"  then sent back to me missing pieces..the battery and back of phone. Blu lacked customer service skills and communication skills.***Final UPDATE ...Blu RMA sent back all of my missing pieces and my phone now works better than before. They even updated my phone for me! Which was awesome of them, so in the end it all worked out for the better. The lady whom I dealt with Lisa, was very nice and very helpful in finding all if my missing parts. My headphone jack even works like new.

Great Phone with its' shape and it has a great touch screen and it works very fast without any freezing..

My mom loves this phone very much. My mom is seventy years old and she feels like a teenager with this phone.

This phone is great, it's not much different than a galaxy s3 or s4, I mean minus the fancy stuff that Samsung added to the screen control. Anyway, I am really sad that this didn't work with Tmobile. I had to return it. The bands are off. I ended up with the Galaxy s4 and, well, it's amazing. It's almost 3x as much money, but it is amazing and will be getting the upgrade for Key Lime Pie.I live the Philadelphia, PA area for anyone considering this phone. It will not work sufficiently with Tmobile. I would assume this would be the same situation for AT&T; because the bands are the same from what I understand.

i dont like how the you cant arrange your apps alphabetically.it also doesn't have nfc but it's decently good for what it's worth.

It is a good celphone, just good enough!!! I had the chance to check it by my own before I bought it, because my sister has it... So I decided to buy it too, it is no too expensive and it is similar to the samsungs... So, it is good. I recomend it, and recomend the seller too.  Thank You!!

Hands down a great product. I have had no problems whatsoever!  I have this phone on Straight Talk, with AT&T SIM card. Really a great phone for the money. I highly recommend the BLU line of cell phones!

the phone is great. quick and smooth. but about two months in the charger got messed up. the micro usb port. so it only charges if i push forward with the charger. and if i move it it wont ccharge so i can only charge it at night when i know i wont use it. and its not a problem in the cable but the actual phone. due to the sellers policy i cannot return or replace the item. i am very dissatisfied with that. i just want a working phone and i would love to just replace it for a non defective one.

i bought this for my dad. i am a techy person, and i am using a nexus phone. my dad loved it and couldnt believe i got this phone for such a low price. screen looks great, it is fast and has a SD card slot. you cant really beat this phone, if you cant buy a nexus, this would be the best thing next to it.

Had this phone a couple months now, & no complaints.  Comes w/ stock Android, no crapware.  Can tether out of the box, no root required.  Comes with a decent case, screen protector, and some nice earbuds!  Camera is great, speakers are great.  Battery life is decent.  Will buy from these guys again!

I bought this phone for my daughter since she likes it.  We are now going on our second return.  Both times the problem has been the same.  The charger port becomes so loose and the phone stops charging.  Twice in a row for two different phones same make.  I now regret telling my friends it is a good phone.  We bought the second one 12/3/13 and as of today 4/4/14 it does not charge.  Will be sending the phone back.  I bought a nexus 4 for myself and have not experienced any problem with his.

I love this phone, firstly it provides functional software, like navigation and google related products. It also has front and back cameras and the battery can be used all day, which is highly recommended. The last and the most important thing is the two SIM card lots, one for micro and one for mini, that really helps for me.

Great!!!

I like it but t always freeze

I really like this phone, maybe its not so popular as the Iphone or the Samsung..but i must say that is NOT a bad stuff. the color is beautiful, is VERY THIN and Confort on my hand...i love it

Unfortunately I had to return it because my house was not catching 3G, but during a time I used it I had no problems at all. I liked the phone, it is similar to SIII, good looks and nice screen display. I had no complaints when I used it. Good product

I chose this phone because of the specs and i really liked it at first. I got the blue one which is really pretty. I also bought my friend a pink one as a gift. Within 3 months both phones stopped charging. I think that all these phones must have faulty charging ports. I wouldn't recommend buying it unless you are looking for a disposable phone.

this is a great phone with a beautiful screen, it feels great on the hand(i have a big hand but my wife also loves it, im buying one for her too).great volume, works wonderfully with any game that i tested it with and i own a lot of games(NFS,asphalt7,crazy taxy etc.you can definetly root it ,just google it, i've played with that but i dont recommend it, just live it the way it is, its fast and smooth.i was amazed at the quality pictures that the camera shoots, video is really good as well.i have no complaints, its a great phone for a great price, i will not renew contract with AT&*the only thing is that you can't find any cases for it anywhere in the web.the solution was that galaxy s4 and htc one x cases fit, you just have to cut out the buttons and camera for it to be perfect.and the screen protector it came with i messed it up so what i did was that i bought a  xtreme guard glaxy nexus screenprotector and just cut out the sensor and the camera and you are set, its easy to do.i hope this helps.........

Before purchasing this phone I did my research, read and listened to a lot of reviews and compared it with other phones. From my research I knew the camera would be a bit of an issue but going from a blackberry with a 2mp camera to this phone I really can't complain. I also thought the phone would be a bit too large but I was so wrong. The phone feels perfect in the palm of my hands. I have had it since the beginning of March and it is working perfectly.Pros:The call quality is great.Lots of apps to choose fromThe phone is lightweight and comfortable (it feels a lot more comfy with the plastic case so I always keep it on)Dual sim capability is great (especially when you live in a country where most persons have two cell phones)It has fallen a few times and I have no idea how it did not break, so it is stronger than it looks.Cons:Although the sound from the headphones is loud and clear they are the &#34;in ear&#34; headphones which I can't use as they don't stay in my ears. I have tried two other headphones but they don't work in this phone.The camera quality of the front facing camera is not perfect (sometimes gets grainy) but it is less megapixels than the back camera. The pictures come out great in good lighting though.Don't forget to purchase an adequate size sd card when buying this if you don't already have one.

I haven't tried Samsung S4 nor Iphones which I don't like, but really I am more tan satisfied with this pone, so I will keep to BLU products as prices are great !

The phone is a great mid range phone and you diffenately get more than what you paid for the only problem I had was their is no NFC.

I love this phone.  It is the best bang for your buck if you are living overseas. Great processing power and great screen resolution.

I've had this phone for almost a month. So far it's been really good. I noticed there was some reviews saying that the battery stopped charging. I will be back to post another review if that happens. So far it's been a great purchase and I am glad I did it!

Got this phone couple weeks ago and am really impressed by what BLU offered. I have used other big boy brands previously (Samsung, HTC, Sony) but this phone stands out. When I say stand out I mean it does everything that I need it to do and did not crush my pocket. Paying upward of $400+ for the name brands and essentailly not using there so call special features was a drag.  The form factor of the LIFE PLAY is PERFECT. The fit in my palm and pocket is super comfy. The device works perfectly with zero issue on my T-Mobile account. Awesome.

Performance is excellent, does everything and more I wanted.Was able to install Flash with the Dolphin browser, view my mail.I was able to do everything with this phone that I had hoped.

I just received this device to replace a Galaxy Note II that I lost.Set up was easy with one major exception. I could not get internet/data via cellular.I called ATT and they verified everything was fine with my account.I narrowed the issue down to the APN settings,  and by trial and error came up with a workable configuration. If yours does not work out of the box, this may work for you.AT&T; APN Settings for BLU PlayMedia NetAPN: wap cingularAPN Type: defaultProxy: not setPort: 8080Username: wap@cingulargprs.comPassword: cingular1Server: not setMMSC: http/device.homeMMS Proxy: not setMMS Port: not setMCC: 310MNC: 410Authentication Type: net setAPN Protocol: IPv4APN roaming protocal: IPv4APN enable/disable: enableBearer: automaticSo far I like it. Its light, has no bloatware apps, and other than a tinny speaker its a great device.

Bought this as a Christmas gift. The person is loving the versatility of the phone and its features and apps. It's a very good phone especially the dual sim feature which is great if you happen to have more than one number. The price is excellent for what is packed into this phone. I need to get one for myself!

I have been using it for a while  (over a month) and I still love it.  It is slightly slower than my galaxy but not enough to bother me.  I like the camera. The screen shot feature is easier on this than my Galaxy Note.  It has never froze.  I am not a big gamer on the cell phone and I don't use a lot of apps at the same time but I think I am a average user. Its works fast enough on the internet. Popped the ATT sim in and I was in business. The yellow one is very pretty.

Great phone for the money nothing Switch from a Iphone to the BLU should have done this long time ago

This is a really nice phone. It's every thing it say it is. I've been using it for a few month and no issues. It takes nice photos. I watch movies, play games, text, FB, SnapChat, GPS, google, email, read books and some times talk on it. I live on my phone. I use it for work as well as play. Battery life is ok, it compares to all the other phones I've had. It's about the same size as an Samsung S4. I like BLU. I got my kid a Blu 5.5 and also had a friend buy a Blu Life Play...all because I really like my phone. I'll get another Blu phone (when I &#34;need&#34; to upgrade. Oh, I have AT&T.

Great Phone for great price with great technology !!! I love this phone and good smart phone to gift a friend. The phone reached on time and expected time.

Its Big! Nice and light. both front( and rear) facing camera for Skype. The only thing I don't like is its not stock android.

This is a very good cell phone, and i can not  see why would anyone need a faster processor. Screen is amazing, it is light and thin. The only complain that i have is the camera. It is noisy, but for the price it is more than adequate. Hopefully it will be reliable as well. If you do not want to spend crazy amounts of money on the phone, get this one, you won't be disapponted.

I tried to make it work without any luck. Even sent to a phone repair shop and was told that it was still locked. Weird.

Its screen is gorgeous. Colors are more saturated than nexus 4 colors. Its fast enough for day to day work.I didn't try any games yet. Camera is not the best but it take OK pictures. Battery last for 3-4 days for light to moderate use. For the price it is the best.

After having a bunch of budget units from mfrs such as Huawei, LG and Samsung, I was in need of a unit that was more powerful but I didn't want to pay the same as a small laptop computer (or more!) to get it (such as is the case with the Apple iPhone and Samsung Galaxy series).  As a result I sought an outside brand that had comparable power  but not a comparable price tag.After several unsuccessful forays into some lesser known (and knockoff) brands, I came across the US made BLU series and specifically the Blu Life Play. It had optics on par with the iPhones & Galaxy series, excellent memory and memory management capabilities, superior App controls and rights management built in and it worked exceedingly well with these options.Most of all it was both UNLOCKED and can go from cellular carrier to carrier (without having proprietary bloatware built in that you cant get rid of) and the native apps management system meant that you could controls third party apps WITHOUT ROOTING THE PHONE.No voiding your warranty or dependence on questionable third party apps and hardware\firmware changes to do what is natively built into this phone in the first place!Pros:good optics, memory, picture and sound quality.All in all the phone is a great value at a good price.Cons:battery life decreases markedly with 3rd party apps, likely due to their desire to communicate constantly over the wireless\cellular connection so for extended use I'd suggest a second spare battery acquired at time of purchase.Screen is VERY sensitive to not only touch but proximity so a call can be interrupted by your chin being too close to the hang up button.  This is reduced considerably with the enclosed protective screen guard or comparable aftermarket screen protectors

Impressed! I was a little bit skeptical in buying this phone bc of how new and uncommon this company is to me. Also because I wasn't sure if it would work with metro PCS new GSM card offering that uses Tmobile's HSPA+ in San francisco (im in Hayward, Ca) and metroPCS voice. Works flawlessly!I'm deff a happy camper. I get between 5-12 MBPS unlimited data. I already had Mepro PCS service, I just went to authorized dealer store here in Hayward and bought a GSM sim card from them for 15$ they install it in and ready to go! The phone quality is excellent doe not look cheap at all Cameras are great too. I can Honestly say it feel more premium than Samsung plastic phones, the case/headphones are good quality and  practical. The Android experience is excellent with this phone. At 229.99 plus tax you are looking at 250ish plus shipping cost depending on what shipping speed you chose. I say its just as good as a Samsung or better. Buy it. I recommend it.

Like many, I was drawn in by the promise of a high end smartphone for a much lower price.  Inititally, I was pretty impressed.  Nice screen and the performance isnt too shabby.  However, after a week, things started to go wrong.  The phone would start randomly shutting down like other reviewers have mentioned.  Now, it refuses to turn on.  I am returning this piece of crap and I will never be getting another blu device ever again.Do yourself a favor.  SAVE YOURSELF THE TIME AND EFFORT AND AVOID BLU PHONES!

Was super apprehensive about buying a phone i never heard of before. But since its a US based company - gave me a little reassurance to take a chance on this.This phone is great. Excellent battery. Good wifi connectivity. Good GPS connectivity. Excellent front & back camera.Slim lightweight design. Great Screen resolution. Good video and audio playback. No carrier bloatware. App2SD support.Awesome overall value. A viable alternative to Nexus 4, 5 and Moto X, Mawesome accessories: Screen guard, shoe lace style earbuds and clear vinyl case.Only a few minor issues prevent me from giving this 5/5:1. the charging port is on the top of the phone and not the bottom (inconvenient when plugged in, mounted on windshield and using navigation) - the cable will interfere with visibility of phone screen2. bottom of the screen is less sensitive that rest of the screen - gotta tap a few extra times before field appears to enter text for sending SMS or IM3. no call icon when looking at contact info in address book. gotta tap the number to call contact.4. low internal storage capacity. 4GB isn't a lot. should be atleast 6GB.

I have had the Blu life play for about a month and it has been great. The phone performs well and has almost all the features of phone triple its cost. A real bargain

Picked this because it was the best value of functions for the money.  Got it as a gift for my wife.  She uses it non-stop.  We have StraightTalk service so she just swapped the sim.  Had to change some settings to get the MMS and Data to work but after changing the settings, everything works perfectly.

This is a great phone!  It was between this and a Samsung and I opted to save some money and take a chance on this one....glad I did!  I have not had it long, and so far the only con that I have discovered is the battery life.  After a 12 hour day it is down over 50%.  I would recommend this to anyone that wants to upgrade but doesn't want to dish out the big bucks.

Front camera stopped workingPhone crashedBattery never stayed chargedAll in less than 6 monthsNice features if that's more important that endurance

Where else will you get a quad core JB 4.2 4.7 inch phone with screen protector, case and even a ear phone with mic for $230. I just got the phone, inserted an ATT SIM, SD card and everything went as planned. Build quality is good, yes the plasticky feeling is there; but once enclosed inside the case provided, the phone feels solid. I am just worried about the charging issues that couple of reviews had mentioned. I will use it for a few weeks to see if I also have the same charging issue, then update my review. If no issues I will definitely bump up the review to 5 stars.I saw another review about this being a re-branded phone. If you think about it, all the phones in the market are manufactured by the same two or three companies like Foxxconn and Flextronics and then &#34;rebranded&#34; by Apple, Samsung etc. So I am not that worried about that point. For now I am happy with the purchase.

Is an amazing smartphone, right price right quality, one of the most sexy smartphone ever. It has all that you will need. It is fast and you can use it with any GSM network company. I don't feel a lost my money.

I was literally shock to see how well put togather the phone was, I mean I was expecting a beat up looking used phone that they claim is new but most of the time is like a refurbish phone, but it was 100 percent new. Everything was in perfect condition. I thought it would be like a low quality phone from all the reviews I've seen but once I set it up I was blown away but how magnificent it was, it actually made me realize how spoiled we are in America always wanting the top quality name brand phones so when a company comes out and makes a phone for international purpose we get all distance cause it's no samsung or iPhone. Yes it's none of those and am happy it's not because in my country the phone service is not that great and don't have no lte either. It comes with 4 gigs of ram I put a 32gig sd card and have all my games and app go straight to it so no space is taking up from the 4 gig problem solved, and android 4.2 is sweet on that phone, the display is nice and crisp. The phone feels solid in my hands once the battery goes in gives it a more weighty feeling and I like that. The phone is amazing to me and am planning on getting another one for my travels and with dual SIMM plus it's under 300 can't ask for nothing more, and it's unlocked so now jail breaking and no spending no 6-700 dollars just to get an unlock phone, I'll stick with blu, they are awesome. Call quality is delicious. If you are looking for a decent phone and don't want to spent refi culo's money for an iPhone or samsung galaxy product that cost 213 dollars to make and charge 6-700 for the phones then blu phones is the way to go.

I ordered this phone for myself because I ordered the blue and pink one from Amazon(shipped and sold from Amazon)for my husband and daughter. They both liked the phone so much I decided to order me one. I tried to buy another one from Amazon and they didn't have them in stock so I clicked on a link for another seller which was L2D2. I got the phone in today and the box was not sealed, there is suppose to be a seal on the box that says "if the seal is missing, don't accept the phone". I called the Blu company at 1-800-974-3165 to verify that there is suppose to be a seal and was told that ALL the cell phones they make has a seal on the box. When I called L2D2 to ask where the seal was, they told me the phones come to them like that, I informed the guy that I just got off the phone with Blu and all phones have seals on them. I guess he didn't think I had the knowledge to contact the manufacture myself and he got VERY NASTY with me on the phone. I told him I wanted my money back and asked for a shipping label and he said they don't issue out shipping labels I had to pay for that out of pocket. I contacted Amazon and told them what was going on and she placed me on hold to call L2D2 to see what the problem was, she came back to the phone and said that they will be investigating them and that they(Amazon) will be dropping them as a seller on their website. The customer service people at Amazon is so helpful and works with you to get any problems solved, I asked the lady if they had gotten any more in stock and she said yes and placed another order for me. I recommend buying a phone or anything else for that matter only when it says "Item sold and shipped from Amazon" because if anything ever happens, Amazon got you covered.P.S. L2D2 don't come on here making comments on the one I just made because we have everything recorded.

I know you are looking at this phone and the spec sheet an thinking "That's an awesome deal" but I'm here to tell you that it's not a good deal.  I purchased the phone on 12/7/13 and on 1/3/13 the screen started flickering. It is also having trouble receiving MMS messages and will not connect to the APN at full speed. There is only a 30 day warranty. Now i have to deal with BLU tech support on Monday and I fully expect delay tactics and red tape to get the phone to a working condition. For $150 more dollars you can get a Google Nexus 5. I own one and it is a great phone. It's made well and I'm sure it will last.When I hold this BLU phone in my hand it feels light and cheap. It feels and functions like something I would expect from a Dollar General store. If you take the battery out of it it weighs about the same as a stack of 10 dollar bills. The touch screen response is sub-par and the case that comes with it feels very, very cheap. No third party company makes a decent case for the phone. When you have the case on; the button to turn the screen on is covered by 1/8" of rubbery plastic. You have to squeeze it with a good amount of force to get it to vaguely respond.I'm not saying don't buy this phone under any circumstances. I'm assuming that you are looking at this phone because you understand that the total cost of ownership on a subsidized phone is ridiculous and you want to save money. I am the same way. I bought this phone for $200 and put a $45 a month straight talk card in it. On paper that is an amazing value for a full featured android phone with data.Before you purchase this phone ask yourself these questions:1. Is the amount of money I'm saving worth the potential loss of time and money when it inevitably breaks in a short period of time?2. Would it actually be cheaper in the long run for me to spend $150 more and get a quality piece of hardware that will last and has the support of one of the largest companies and communities in the world (Nexus 5)?

is the best cell phone I could buy, cheap, versatile, slim, fast, the screen is perfect, it has nothing to envy to the phones of competition, 100% recommended

I bought this phone in January for my wife.  Within 3 weeks the phone screen went black.  It seemed to still be working because we kept hearing it make noises and notifications. Was not bought from amazon so I've been working with the blue or ct miami company.  Won't ship a replacement to use while its being repaired. Won't pay for shipping.  Will repair after we pay shipping back to them for a product we already paid for now have to pay more to keep it working.  They've  now had it 2 weeks and called and tried to get an update... no answer... emailed and got a reply were still trying to figure out what is going on... I asked for a replacement as this phone was bought in 1/2014 has been out of duty for more time and it has been in duty.  Answer from the company...&#34; oh well you shouldn't have bought our phone&#34;. If I could have left a negative number review I would.  wanted to let everyone know the problems with this company.

Hi everybody if your looking a cheap really fast and slim unlocked phone this is it the company is very generous they include a charger,batter,case,headphones,screen protector, and charge I will finish the rest of the review next week on my final over view on everything.

I give it 4 stars because i am still learning it but i like it so far. This is my frist cell phone and its really cool.

Excellent phone for the price. Sure the specs aren't up to par with the 2013 flagships but who really cares?Did experience some trouble with the phone randomly rebooting but a simple and quick factory reset did the trick. Aside from that the phone has been great.Pros: very nice display, vanilla android (somewhat), build quality is very good (phone feels solid), free case and screen protector, and camera is great.Cons: lack of accessories, not compatible with some wired earphones

I did a video review on the HTC one vs the Blu Life Play you all can take a look and see these two phones go head to head.[...]

gets a five for me. The phone is fast and great for the price. All what you expect from android.

For the price I paid, I am very impressed with the hardware specification of this phone.  For software, mine shipped 4.2.1 version of Android.  With it's 1.2Ghz quad-core processor, 1G RAM, bright screen, decent battery life, I am a happy camper.  A comparable brand name device would cost me double.  I use it with StraightTalk.  I pay about $45 a month no contract.  Data rate is about 3Mbps down where available.ConsI wasn't too impressed with build quality though.  l would make sure to use the phone case that comes with it.  The external speakers aren't that great, the audio hardware isn't that great.Get it!

I've had the phone a about a month now and really like it.  This is my first smart phone so I have nothing to compare it too.  It took a little exploring to get the data plan to work but it's working fine now.  I used a combination of settings from some of the past amazon reviews.  I'm running the phone thru Consumer Cellular on ATT network; they hadn't ever heard of the brand and didn't know how it would work with there company, but it's been fine so far.

Bought this phone in November 2013 from Amazon.After 3 months stopped working. Contacted customer care. Sent the phone to customer care and delivered on February 26, 2014.As of today I have not received my phone and still company says they will send as soon as possible.Its very frustrating and waste of money as I end up paying phone bills without using the phone. Try other alternatives like Moto G which works reliably and good customer support.

i am loving this cellphone so far.. the only thing that i think me and most of the people who brought it is about the earphone.. it basically just works good with the earphone that comes with the phone.  I hate the earphone that comes with, i hate that thing inside my ears so its a really problem for me, but that is it... the phone works good, have a great battery life.. thanks blu for making a cheap and great product ! i just want u guys to fix thi problem with the earphones.

I have only had this phone for a couple days, so far.  It seems to be a very good device thus far.  I ram some initial benchmarks and it rated very well.  Very smooth display.  Nice feel quality.  Popped in StraightTalk sim on ATT network, updated APN, and works great. Picks up HSPA+ network with pretty good download and browsing speeds.  Seems like a winner so far, but I will try to update in a few weeks.Updated 3/15/2014:I fail to get back sooner to update my review, but here I go.  I purchased this phone on 7/25/2013.  Today I am pleased to advise that this phone has held up marvelously.  It is by far the best phone I've had.  I say this not from a pure specs perspective, but from pleasure perspective.  This phone was more pleasurable to have and use than the Galaxy S2, iPhone 4, HTC Rezound.  The camera works very well in good lighting.  Not so well in dark areas, but that goes for most cameras not just camera phones.A few cons:1. Not a lot of storage (get you an SD card)2. Spotty data speeds on StraightTalk (more an issue with service than phone)3. Can't find extra battery or cases/coversOther Pros:1. Great battery life2. Root-able3. Very responsive4. Nice screen displayTotally happy with this phone.  Will consider BLU for next phone also.

I had this phone for a month now it&#8217;s a nice phone with nice screen resolution I think the screen look better than S3 However, I had a dead cell on the screen which bother me a lotI might call them soon to see if warranty cover dead cellsThe battery is fine not great and not badProsNice screen resolution/PixelsNice CameraNew android softwareNice sizeCheap priceIt comes with a cover, screen protector and headphonesConsSmall ram and processer / The phone might stop while playing a gameCheap quality materialsLow soundNo accessories

I bought two Blu Life Plays for my wife and myself for the Christmas. We love this phone. It can do anything a much more expensive Android phone can do but at a much lower price and with no string attached. We put in the Micro SD card and increased the capacity to 36 GB, which is adequate. The only issue I want to raise is the 8 megapixels camera. The pictures taken are not that sharp, expecially indoors or under cloudy skies. But with this price, it is understandable.

I would also since it's unlocked dual sim card, the best option for service with the blu products would be with Solavei/T-mobile phone service. I will be ordering my Studio 5.3 s soon and wife she wants the Blu life play sooo... in the next few weeks most likely. I as well will connect it with Solavei. Plus, I hear that if you share with 3 people you get i think like $20 for every 3 people and if you refer 9 people you made enough to cover your bill and your phone bill is free. So, yes I will be connecting my Blu phone when i order it with that company. Great website to amgstaff love it thanks you for telling us about that man because everybody who gets any unlocked phone needs a great service provider no contract... for $49 unlimited talk text data 4g and nationwide with tmobile signal man that's what I need! But, get this phone people great stock android phone! it's not a samsung galaxy so don't go crazy comparison but rather know it's a stock android OS system that's really all you need! [...] distributes Solavei phone service so go check them out.

No issues so far.  It works like Samsung galaxy. I love it. Comes with user manual. Optional micro SD card required for more storage.

I bought this Phone a about a month ago and i can tell you that is a great Phone really snappy, a full day battery life with a hard use, great screen, really amazing headphones with amazing basses, i used the iPhone headset (yeah it works) and i can tell you that the blu life headphones are way way better, i live in M&eacute;xico and i haven't had a problem, i just insert my micro sim and voala!! I really recomend it is a great phone AND THE PRICE ONLY $229!!!! You won't have any problems with this device, buy it!!!

For years I have been waiting for a real dual ACTIVE unlocked cell phone that will enable me to tether while I am talking on the phone.  This product is doing that and then some.  I have T-Mobile on sim1 and unlimited 3G with tethering on sim2.  Once you correctly set up your 3G setting you&#8217;re good to go.  BLU Life Play,  you may not be a Samsung, Motorola, or any big name out there,  but this phone has outdone them all (for now). The price, you can easily pay $400 plus for this kind of unlocked cell phone caliber .  HIGLY RECOMMENDED!

I just bought this smartphone, it does exactly what I was expecting from a smartphone is supposed to do. The 720p HD resolution camera y great, very good pictures... the apps installed are fine... the battery is big enough, so I expect a better good battery life and performance... the dard grey color is lovely, the feel in the hands is great, size is as Samsung Galaxy S3, speed is wow, and Im not supposed to make use of two sims, but it does have to ports for two sims (primary micro size and second normal size), have not yet used the earphones... the first time charge, it dit it quickly ( 4 hours or so), and this phone came with screen protector and a silicone Cover, what else can I expect?? I found out this phone is manufactured by a south korean company, and I know south korean manufacture very good products... I will update this info in a few months... see you later...

I can't really comment on all the technical aspects or do a comparison between this and a much more expensive brand, because I could never afford to spend $600 on a phone. I will share with you though that if you are looking for a great smart phone at a great price, this is the one. I purchased directly from amazon for the peace of mind. You truly can never go wrong with a company that understands customer service as well as they do. The package includes a case, screen protector, ear buds and of course a charger. If you ask me, the picture on this is amazing and everything works exactly as it should. Calls are very clear and audible. It locks onto GPS without a hiccup and seems to pickup WiFi hotspots almost as soon as they become available making for an even faster experience. I have net10 service, just pop your Sim card in and you are set to go. I personally did not have to alter any APN settings in order for everything to work flawlessly. If you find yourself reading the reviews of this and you are on the fence about it, I would highly recommend purchasing. It is an awesome phone for everyday use. The rear facing camera is pretty good provided the lighting is correct, low light pictures do appear a bit grainy. The camera is beyond sufficient for my purposes but others may place a higher value on this.

I'm not a phone whiz at all but I've been researching my next phone for quite a while now and the Life Play seemed to have everything I wanted at a great price (ok...I did really want the Life One  but couldn't wait for it). Got it today, and voila! I'm up and running! Set up is easy, all very intuitive. Call quality is great. Main camera is awesome and front camera really darn good. Can't comment on the data speeds yet as I am using a t-mobile sim at the moment and limited to 2G because the phone isn't 1700/2100 (t-mobile's 3g/4g frequencies). My new sim card (for use on AT&T 1900 band) will be here in a day or two so we'll see but I have high hopes for high speed based on the amazing wi-fi speed. And did I mention that the phone is super light, amazing screen colors and a very lovely blue color. Again, I would have preferred the yellow but was too impatient so I opted for the blue and I really like it. Also appreciate the included cover and screen protector.

I was looking for a phone somewhat like the Samsung Galaxy but not with the price tag. This phone came to the rescue. It works perfectly like any other smartphone (android) out there. The product specification is exactly true.When I opened the box, I got the following items, besides the phone:1. user manual2. screen shield3. case (it comes in the color of the phone - it protects the bottom only)4. ear piece5. usb cable and chargerLooking for a case other then the one which comes with the phone is hard. They do not sell a case fit for this BLU phone anywhere in the US, so I had to look somewhere else...and voila....bought one here: [...] The BLU Life Play's name in China is Gionee Elife E3....so you can look up any accessory you like under that name and it will work on the BLU Life Play.The case fits the phone perfectly and is pretty nice looking.Overall, I am very satisfied with my purchase of this BLU phone......I can wapp my friends, use FB....even BBM can be downloaded AND I have a cool camera.

Way too many issues with the phone after about a month.No lie. Battery died or phone wouldn't charge., just got it replace. took a month and got it back with a broken camera.Please avoid until this company can get that stuff together.

I came from a Samsung Galaxy Advance, which when driving and playing music over Bluetooth, using GPS and occasionally doing something on the phone at a red light, would freeze or lag a little bit. Also the screen was somewhat small.So I wanted a faster and slightly bigger phone but without having to pay for a SIII or a Nexus 4.I bought this phone and I'm very satisfied.+ Fast.+ Nice feel.+ Nice screen.+ Included case is a nice plus.Nevertheless, as I paid less, I received less in some areas:- Instead of Gorilla Glass you get a screen protector, but just one. I accidentally got a particle between the film and the screen, so that was annoying.- Earphones are kind of ugly and uncomfortable, at least for me. I won't use them.- I can't encrypt my phone data, as other android devices allow. When I asked technical support they simply replied that option is not available right now.All in all I'm very happy with my purchase (I paid a lot less!!) and I hope more companies start offering low price quality products.

Very good product

so first off this phone is awesome had it for a few days b4 writing to play with it a bit and i must say im more than blow away by its performance. it has a glorious screen and nice and light in your hands. the price is not even the best part of this phone, though it is a deal maker. the data speeds are well on par, functionality of it is great. no lags so far. smooth camera, front and back. Surprisingly in the box it includes; a screen protector and gel case, since everyone was so worried bout the phone having no case and lack of protection, i think BLU Products did a great job with that addition and a nice pair of headphones to boot. So far my customization of the phone is going without any snags, and despite the 4GB storage i just got a $15 32GB SD card right here on amazon and you just set the phone to use it as a main storage destination, once again all smooth transitions. Also friend of mine already has one. I totally recommend getting this phone, its awesome and also if your on a budget too. will update with more later

I love my phone! I did my research before choosing one. I have Net10 with the AT&T; sim card. The APN settings they gave worked for everything except MMS and they kept telling me it was my phone! So i did some more research and found a forum where people experienced the same issue. It just took a simple change in the proxy name and viola! LolMy only issue is wondering about rooting the phone. I want some features that were offered with ice cream sandwich (like removing the names under my icons and having a banner). Anyone have any suggestions?

satisfied would not be the word I can use is that there is not, the phone is great, fast, its design is super slim, the screen looks amazing and I lived playing in and watching movies in hd and all incredible change much phone and me this hard. right now I'm waiting for the S version which I hope will be just as good.

Physically the phone is almost identical to a Galaxy S3, however in terms of performance it is a lot closer to the current generation of phones (GS4, HTC One).  Also, big bonus, they are supporting the operating system as I've already received an update.  Very happy!!

I am very impressed and happy after having used it for one week. It is slim, sharp, beautiful and fast. Step up was smooth. Tmobile 4G connection in NYC area. Looking forward to Blu Life One.

It's a good phone and it functions as expected. Looked up the specs on GSM Arena and got what I expected unlocked. My only problem with the phone is that it feels too light, as if it can't be dropped at all.

Very unhappy with this blu life play phone. I have a mirco SD card in it and it works when it wants too, lets me save more apps, save more pictures, then later it just stops working.  My SD card still has plenty of storage space. The camera stops working notifying me that there is no card to save pictures.Sometimes the phone just stops and restarts constantly, going back to my HTC. No one should buy this phone just terrible.

It keeps restarting even during a call. Don't know why it does that. I'm really dissatisfied and disappointed. Needs improvement

Just got this phone today and I liked it as soon as I opened the box!  Easy set up! Sleek Look! Works very well.  I will update this review in another 30 days but I just had to say something today.

WHY BLU PRODUCTS ???? Let me tell you the real situation about the blu phones. The decent quality, 2 sim cards, good prices, good specs for a budget phone and TERRIBLE SUPPORT OR NO SUPPORT AT ALL. THINK twice before buy anything from BLU PRODUCTS COMPANY.Short story - you bought the BLU phone and its working with no issues - you very LUCKY !! start playing lottery $) and be happy BLU PRODUCTS owner.Long story - you bought the BLU phone and you have some issues (DOA, headphone jack broken, black pixels on the screen, short battery life, Android is always low on memory, ECHO on microphone .. screen clicking by itself ...etc ) - welcome to HELL !!If you still have refund or replacement period = you lucky again. Otherwise - YOU JUST WAISTED 200$-300$ from your wallet. If you want to find the truth $) be my guest = read the whole story = IT WILL SAVE YOU A LOT OF TIME AND PAIN !!!First off I had 4 Smartphone's. (3 had issues)2012 1st Blu Studio 5.3 - black dots, bad design of case - the screen was visible detached from system board. = sent for replacement.2012 2nd Blu Studio 5.3 - first half year great phone for its money. (270$) great battery life - 4-5 days with 5.3 screen = very happy. until the headphone jack stopped working normally - some hiss sound with tapping when you plug the headphones. no more movies or private conversations on the go ... Tried to fix it... went to couple stores for repair - the verdict unfixable ... Give it away to my neighbors to use it as GPS on his car.Tried to contact BLU Products for warranty repair - welcome to some BLU marry-go-round - "please contact distributor" and distributor replays ... since its out of 30 days from the day of purchase - "please contact BLU products" I did wrote around 30 yes its 30 !!!!! emails ... trying to resolve this issue ... still no help.Hmm ... I am still trying to find the truth $) and some service . I did find the email of CEO of BLU Products ... and sent to him all my correspondence with the supervisors from BLU and Vendor stamped by dates ... in one huge email .... just to be relieved of this whole nonsense and terrible customer support.2013 3rd BLU STUDIO 2 - To be honest I was surprised when I got answer from him directly . Very delicate and nicely written letter with apology and offer to get new model of BLU STUDIO 5.3 Smartphone !!! free of charge. OMG all this emails .. looking for help finally paid off... HAPPY END ???? NO WAY only half story ...When I got new Smartphone BLU Studio 5.3 II. It worked nicely for couple weeks than ... its start failing APART.Here are list of issues with BLU smarphone1) Clicking by itself ... and the screen is not responsive a lot of times (even when I did factory reset and as test did capture couple pictures ... it happened again and again)enjoy the terrible unknown feature by BLU products smartphone .... clicking by itself randomly ... can happen 1 time in a week or 5 times during the DAY !!![...][...][...]2) Low RAM ... Even with couple applications since its only 512 mb of ram its freezing and shutting down apps . A lot of freezing with GPS on and map from Google with data connection on and Bluetooth on. Especially when trying to play music on background ... its start freezing and shutting down applications by itself.3) Very low battery life ... the original BLU were holding up to 4-5 days of active use ... this one ... less than a DAY. (I did charging now 2 times a day)4)Echo - a lot of complains from my coworkers and friends .So I did start warranty service on this "gift" from CEO of BLU PRODUCTS. I was out of states for work... So it took me a several weeks to send for repair/ replacement.I was assured multiply times that if issues (the main one - clicking on the screen by itself) will be confirmed - they will replace it with new model.But in real life ...another 20 emails ... no real help ... only promises to resolve the issue and make me happy. they tried to charge me 80$ for replacing wet ?? system board .. and finally sent back pretty much same unit with replaced screen, system board and same defective battery ... nice job....when I asked why they not replaced the battery ... I got answer that 6 hours its OK for BLU phones ... so you OK to charge it 2-3 times a day !!!! If you need new battery go buy the new one....2013 4th BLU STUDIO 2 - So for now I did give it to friend as present. with explanation - no obligation from me.... and if something will happen to this phone ??? I don't care and don`t do anything Real to help with this wonderful Smartphone. Lesson learned from BLU PRODUCTS support. $) Good luck.

Overall the Blu Life Play is a great phone. But to use the review system properly i will tell you the pros and cons of the device.Pros: *It has a large crisp screen, the battery will last an entire day of heavy use and still have about 40% remaining (so not quite a two day usage), the camera on the phone is pretty nice but if your looking to get any nice zoomed in pictures it not that reliable, probably the best feature on this phone is the lack of bloatware.Now before I say any cons remember that there will be far more problems mentioned simply because it is much easier to find the bad things in a product rather than the good.Cons: the internal storage is very small so it almost essential that you get a large SD card. Even with the &#34;quad core&#34; in the life play I have noticed a few slow points which may also have to do with the meager 1 G of ram. One thing that may just be my device. It will simply not turn at the most random times. I only had to take out the battery and put it back in to fix.

THIS IS A REAL MED/ENTRY LEVEL ANDROID PHONE. AM RESELLING THIS PHONE IN THE BAHAMAS, AN USING IT AS MY DAILY DRIVER. I MUST GIVE BLU PROPS WIT THIS MODEL. FOR THE SPECS AN ADDED GEL CASE AN SCREEN PROTECTOR, IS A ADD PLUS IN MY BOOK. I WUD TELL ANYBODY LOOKIN FOR A ANDROID TO BUY THIS. BATTERY LIFE IS GREAT, EVEN WITH A MIXTURE OF WIFI AN DATA ALWAYS ON, ONE CAN GET BOUT 10-11 HOURS ON A CHARGE. SO IF YOU DONT WANT TO BREAK THE BANK BUT DONT WANT A SMALL SCREEN PHONE THE BLU LIFE PLAY IS THE WAY TO GO!

Phone came in box with seals stating &#34;DO NOT ACCEPT IF THIS SEAL IS BROKEN&#34;. Seals were broken. Will be evaluating contents of box and item to see if tampered with or used.

The screen is big, bigger than those on similar phones used by our friends. The &#34;buttons&#34; are large enough for our fingers to manipulate. The camera works well (although it can be difficult to hold the phone when taking photos with the camera without pressing the volume button and turning it down). We do wish it came with better instructions; the manufacturer seems to have assumed that most people have had enough experience with these types of phones to not need them, but for those of us finally upgrading from our circa 2002 phones (yes), that just isn't true. Nevertheless, we discover new features often (new to us, anyway), and recommend this phone to all who ask about it.

I did a lot of research before buying a dual sim Blue Life Play Ll00a.  Out of the box, I was really impressed with the phone and like the slim design.  I was able to get the SIM2 slot hooked up to Fido in Canada and it works well, however I was hoping to get a Virgin Mobile or Koodo sim for the SIM1 slot and I couldn't get them to work at the kiosk.  I also tried at the Bell and Telus kiosks and neither of these carriers worked even though based on the specs, the phone should work.I have talked to Blu technical support who was marginally helpful at best and basically just told me that I got a Dead-on-Arrival phone and to send it back to the company I bought it from.  Pretty disappointed with this as I priority international shipped the phone to Canada to have it available for a 1 month trip I am about to take in 2 days to Australia.  Blu technical support basically said that you can get DOA phones with any manufacturer, which I don't disagree with, but my concern is that I'm buying from a newer company without the track record or reputation of one of the majors and getting a DOA phone sends up serious red flags for me that an exchange may have technical issues as well.  I would hope that with a new company sending out quality product that has been tested is highly important so as not to damage your reputation.

This is surprisingly, a wonderful unlocked phone that is feature rich at this price point, without any carrier subsidy, that is.  The phone's design and build quality are impressive while the hardware specs are at mid level at best.  Nonetheless, from the price-to-performance/features ratio perspective, I feel this phone comes out on top, particularly after owning several types of phones, including Samsung.  In addition, BLU actually provides tech support.  I contacted support once before the purchase, another time after, via email.  Support responded on both occasions within 24 hours.  OTA firmware is available.  I've downloaded twice thus far.Phone reviews are usually very subjective because we all use the device in different ways.  In my case, my phone, besides being a phone, is mostly my internet gateway when I'm away from my computers.  I rarely have more than 15 apps on my phone therefore a small amount of storage doesn't bother me.  This phone does have a microSD slot so storage can be extended that way and the phone provides the option to select the preferred app storage location when it detects a microSD card.I also seldom play games on phone so a 1GB RAM is sufficient to me.  What I rely heavily on is connectivity speed.  Hence, my review will focus on this subject matter where I think is often a grey area on non-carrier branded unlocked phones.  All other features are widely published and there are very detailed reviews provided by other owners already.As an unlocked phone, I used it on AT&T; for 3 weeks and I'm now on T-Mobile.  This phone (L100a) supports 850/1900MHz which plays well with both carriers.  Since T-Mobile has a large re-farmed coverage in SF Bay Area on 1900MHz, getting HSPA+ service is not a problem at all.  What I haven't seen it achieve as advertised yet, is the up to 42Mbps speed on either AT&T; or T-Mobile.  Then again, this speed is probably very subjective to the carriers and none other than a theoretical speed .  The maximum speed recorded in my tests was 12Mbps which is more than sufficient for most activities over the internet.** NB: BLU Life PLay L100i will not receive 3G service on T-Mobile due to the** lack of 1900MHz support on the phone.What I can share with you is that this phone is solid on both AT&T; and T-Mobile networks in terms of mobile data connection.  When using this phone as a hotspot (tethering), my Android tablet allows me to access internet at what seemingly the same speed as using Verizon LTE Jetpack hotspot.  By no means I'm implying this phone can rival LTE speed.  I'm certain LTE speed will easily edge out 3G speed in bulk download tests.  Further, mobile data connection speed varies from hour to hour, location to location.  As such, I sure think this phone is solid HSPA+ device.I've noticed a few issues:1) When tethering is on and the phone is in power saving mode, mobile data will be cut off after 5 minutes when the phone display is off.  The workaround is to turn off power saving mode during tethering session.  I've reported this to Support and hope to receive an OTA update fix.2) Headset with inline MIC incompatibility is quite a nuisance but not without a workaround.  The phone uses OMTP standard which is incompatible with most newer headsets with inline MIC released in the past 12~18 months.  If you run into this problem with your favorite headset, you can simply get a CTIA to OMTP converter.  Regular headphone (without MIC) is not a problem.3) GPS can take up to 2 minutes to lock on.Lastly, I did not have to perform manual APN setup AT&T; or when I switched to T-Mobile.  APN setting is always picked up automatically on boot up.  Here's the APN setting for T-Mobile network:APN: epc.tmobile.comAPN Type: Not setProxy: Not setPort: Not setUsername: Not setPassword: Not setServer: Not setMMSC: [...]MMS Proxy: Not setMMS Port: Not setMCC: 310MNC: 260Authentication Type: Not setAPN Protocol: IPv4APN roaming protocal: IPv4APN enable/disable: enableBearer: UnspecifiedCheers!

The phone died today, less than three months after purchasing it, the battery won't charge at all and the camera sucks and now it says i can't return it, no warranty whatsoever.**UPDATE**I called ct-miami, they told me to send the phone, i did, and i personally went to their office to pick up the phone, they fixed it and even gave me a new battery, the phone is working perfect now.

WOW GOT THIS PHONE LAST WEEK AND IT JUST BLEW MY MIND. SCREEN VERY RESPONSIVE, 4G SPEEDS, GREAT BATTERY LIFE, STOCK ANDROID CAN BE MODED , UMM JUST A GREAT PHONE ALL I GOT TO SAY ALL THE BIG PHONE COMPANIES BETTER WATCH BLU !

l am very happy with this phone,  this is my first experience with  a smart phone and it is easy to operate. The pictures are of good quality.

I wanted a dual Sim phone and did a lot of research prior acquiring this one. I love it! I've had blackberries for several years (and still do) but wanted another phone to use while travelling.Had never used an android before but it was really easy to learn!The quality of the camera is amazing and the quality is definitely better than what I had anticipated. The kit comes with a screen protector and a case. Didn't really like the case but that is such a minor issue...I'm really satisfied with the product!
