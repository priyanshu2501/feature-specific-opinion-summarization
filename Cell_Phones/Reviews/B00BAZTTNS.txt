LG really did a good job with this phone, the processor is fast and responsive, it comes with so many features, easy to use, it is light and slim, it looks really nice and the camera is good too, I'm happy with the quality of the pictures, I love it. The price is good here in Amazon, you actually save $40 comparing with Metro PCS. So far I have no issues, except for the first time when I activated it through the automated service (*228) with metro it did not activate the 4G, so I had to call and talk to a real person who finally got the phone working with the 4G network. Also, I was having issues sending text messages with pictures but I called again and  they fixed it. It seems that since the phone was purchased online, it was not set up properly with Metro network, but that's not an issue with the phone itself, the phone works great. My suggestion is don't waste your time activating your phone with the automated service, call Metro PCS and get it activated with a real person to have the phone set up properly the first time. I would recommend this phone.

I will admit the phone has its flaws that will drive you crazy but i found the screen to be nice and clear and an alright size well priced good phone for metro, calls sometimes echo battery life is alright as long as you dont have wifi on all the time and brightness at 100% sound wise its ok i will say im some what satisfied with the phone but overall 3 stars.

Everything ive always wanted. I will keep this phone for a long time...Id be lost without it !  5 stars

The physical design of the phone is much better than a lot of others at the time. Has removable battery and microSD card slot, which a lot of other phones no longer have because Apple manages to somehow sell phones like that and other companies decided to as well. No, stop that, especially you, HTC... It's pretty fast and screen is nice. Camera is nice. The whole phone is nice, better than the S3 for the price in my opinion. Just get rid of all the Metro bloat ware and you're set.

I won't write much since the other reviews state everything. But I purchased this phone a year ago. It was working flawlessly until about two months ago when I started to experience some freezing. The phone itself wouldn't freeze but when I wet to type all my letters would come capitalized and no words would e my message. Th time would freeze and the texting issue would happen. I'd have to restart my phone and it would eat my battery life when it did that. If I had 90% of battery all of a sudden after that I would have 50% of battery. And it could have only been stuck like that for 2-5 minutes.Just a couple weeks ago I have started to experience over heating for the phone where it gets really hot and I experience the same freezing problem. Now that it's hot out I'm experiencing over heating.I don't get these problems everyday, these problems seem to come when I hang out with one of my friends. It's only with that one person and frequently with that one person. It's like my phone secretly hates them and me for hanging out with them. This very rarely ever happens any other time.

Nice speed and good size screen. Very responsive touch screen. I'm enjoying it very much and battery life is really good.

Very Smart phone. 4G, Google Play, Many Extras, Battery pretty long lasting. I'm supposed to write more but I don't have anything else to say.

best phone for the money, pound for pound all day. unfortunately I dropped mine in water, and metropcs will no longer support cdma phones starting 2015

So, I'm brand new to 4G and Android as well......just gave up on my Curve 8530 I had for 2 years.The first impressions after the switch - I was speechless !!!I wanted to go for the Galaxy S3 from MetroPCS as well but I heard about the MetroPCS/T-Mobile merger and also about the arrival of Galaxy S4 to Metro in a short while, so I figure the S3's gonna be worth about half after that release. I decided to go for a cheaper (almost just as good) model the LG Spirit :)This phone is a beast, a savage I have a '06 Toshiba Satellite laptop and this phone would easily kick it's ass in any hardware aspect.Love the OS, the games look just AMAZING - though bear in mind my last cellphone gaming session was on a BB Curve 8530 so it's a big switch for me.The 4.5" IPS display is gorgeous and the camera is recording in 1080p (the face camera does 720p), 4G LTE connectivity is wonderful the download speed is fire and with 802.11g/n WIFI this thing downloads with almost the same speed my Asus G75VX with 802.11ac antenna does - unbelievable !!!Some games literally have PS3/XBOX360 quality graphics !!!The phone is capable of taking voice commands and does it with precision, I'm yet to have it misunderstand what I dictated - all you do is press a speaker icon on the display.I seem to be going round and round with this review, I know;Let me get straight to the good and the bad if any :DPros:1.2GHz dual-core CPU;1GB RAM DDR2 (monster);4.5" 960x540 screen - flips 180*;720p face camera + 5MP 1080p rear camera with 1080p recording;Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich;4.3GB of internal storage space;speed;ease of use;intuitive OS/UI;battery life (so far so good);there's more I'm just tired today and gotta wrap-up;Cons:the process of adding files to SD card;Google keyboard glitches;I think it's one of the best phones MetroPCS has to offer right now, especially when you take in account the price it goes for, gross bill was only $308+change and what this baby is capable of doing and the speed it DOES it with. It's a no-brainer, as good as Galaxy S3/S4 are I think the LG Spirit can easily keep up with the best and therefore deserves a rightful place and a good review.I will elaborate on this naughty piece of technology a bit more in a few days......08/23/13So, I have this phone for a while now and just have to mention a few new thing I observed over time.....after about 4 months now the Andriod OS lost a bit of it's speed it had before but nontheless the Spirit still keeps up and does everything well.The most important and surprising feature is the battery: it lasts forever !!! BB Curve used to kill me with the this, the battery would die on me while the phone was in my pocket and when I need to use it it's done :/This one takes 4G/WIFI, web surfing, calls, games, e-mail ect. for hours at a time and I never have any sudden drops in battery power.....it might not be a big deal but I was expecting even less with all the features I use everyday.I know the Samsung S4 is here and it's a lot better but the $550 price is high, so if you can live without the latest most expensive toy, this phone has a lot to offer for a very reasonable price and also has some of the best quality amongst phones worth a lot more $$$.

Love this phone I purchased it because my sister has its little brother(LG Motion) which is basically the same phone(processor and operating system) just an inch smaller screen and I liked her phone it had awesome reviews and I can say I'm not disappointed its very fast and has a screen that's perfect for me. Its thinner than the motion so even thought its bigger its still comfortable in my pocket. Now even though its thinner it has a bigger battery 2600mah so I go a little over two days on a charge and that's with calls, texting, watching videos on you tube, watching Netflix and surfing the web. Just remember to close your applications when your done with them if you leave them running or on stand by any phone will be a hog with the battery. I also have the screen brightness set to 30 percent which also helps to preserve the battery the screen usually uses the most power. Anyway for metro pcs I feel its their best phone with the motion a close second.

I really like the phone. Phone came on time and in good shape. Nice big screen, very similar to the lg motion

I went from an LG Motion to an LG Spirit a couple of days ago, and I have to say."I love it ". I absolutely fell in love with the Motion but thought the screen needed to be a little bigger for all it does for the media. Upon use, I literally couldn't put it down. I just wanted a phone to play games and watch movies on, with maybe a few calls every now and then. Now I can watch Netflix and play Angry Birds all I want. So naturally, when I found out The new LG Spirit was almost exactly like the Motion with the bigger screen I wanted, I knew that I would have to have it. It does so much more than the LG Motion though. Not only is it a bigger phone, but it also has a video editor. The Lg Spirit has exceeded my expectations, and has become the last cell phone I'll ever own. Thanks to LG for making such, Metro PCS for providing the service, and amazon.com for lower prices. AMAZING!!!

Love the phone! No problems with phone have had it for about 1 month now and is quick. Glad I got the phone. I was going to get the galaxy but to much money plus tax too so decided to get this one. The only difference I see is the megapixel but who cares I did not want this phone for pictures that is why a have a camera . Thanks amazon for hooking it up. I know it was cheaper here about 30 bucks then buying it on metro.com The metro store charges more and they charge you for activating it too.

Best smartphone for Metropcs besides Samsung Galaxy.I have not seen anything bad about this phone yet. I had the phone 3 weeks already.The 4G service is really 4G compared to Tmobile service. I would recommend the $5 or $60 plan to enjoy the true 4G service.This phone is worth every dollar.

I had been to two metro PCS stores to ask them if they would activate my phone if I bought it from a place other than their store. I do not know how all these people talk so high of LG spirit phone got it activated if they bought it from a source other than a metro PCS store. can any one enlighten me ?LG Spirit 4G LTE Prepaid Android Phone (MetroPCS)

The is the best phone that I have ever had.  The metro internet works pretty fast on it.  the phone navigates smoothly.  I replaced the esteem which was like a robot.  Get this phone!

A little more than a month ago I bought the ZTE Avid. After a month of suffering, I threw in the towel and bought the LG Spirit; and so far love it. I believe that it is worth the extra money over the cost of the lesser offerings from Metro. Everything works as you would expect that it should.  The one thing that it lacks that the Avid had is a little light that flashes to notify you that you missed a call or other event.  A small app from the Google Play Store called NoLED adds a little light to the screen that solved the problem.

I Purchased the LG Spirit Once My Phone Got Here i Was Very Pleased With It Runs Great Its Fast And Smooth One Of The Best Phone Metro Has Now Right Up There With The Galaxy It Cheaper Reliable Signal Is Great Call Quality Is Good Wish The Phone Had A Better Camera But Its Still Good Either Way I Recommend To Anyone Who Looking For An Affordable Phone***** 5 Stars*****

Gotta be honest here...this phone is quick and lag free! ...... I purchased this phone for the wife. Her phone broke after 3 years, so it was up to hubby to replace it. After reading the reviews, I decided this would be an ok phone for her mundane &#34;tech free&#34; life...wow, i'm pleasantly surprised! I have the Lg Esteem...and this phone smokes it! Needless to say, I will be purchasing this phone as well...the 14yr old can have the Esteem.The only thing preventing me from giving it a solid 5 ...  the camera

i just upgraded and im very happy with the new phone, i love that i can record and take pictures at the same time ,my daughter hates staying still for a pic but with this phone i can take pictures very fast,  i didnt have to go to the store to activate just dail *228 and follow the steps it will connect to customer service if your having problems doing it yourself

By snap shot do you mean screenshot. If so you can take a screenshot by pressing the lockscreen and home button at the same time or you can go to quick memo and hit save from there

coool=i just orderf this fone and hopefully it dnt do me wrong cuz its thin u knw so hopfully its goood

After comparing various phones and its feautures, this one seemed very up to date and reasonably priced. Very pleased with its fast operation. It's basically a phone tablet in my opinion. I have it in a all black hard case and looks very slick. Would definately recommend this phone. As we are all individuals with different wants, can't go wrong with this one.

I've had this phone for about a week, I absolutely love it so far! one of the best thing is the battery life I use my phone all day texting, Facebook, talking, pictures and Twitter it last most the day I usually don't have to recharge it until the evening time. Front facing camera is very cool, the Camera takes pictures super fast, the video camera is awesome as well, it's huge in size, bright colors and a clear screen very easy to use and user friendly, the apps open very fast the phone in general is smooth, phone calls are crystal clear, the ringer and other notification are loud and clear. I have a few things that bother me and they are I can't figure out how you turn swype off or maybe you can't, I have wifi at home and when I am here it's always on but my Facebook app runs very slow, won't load pictures, won't open the comments, and a few times it wouldn't upload pictures to FB not sure if it's the service or not but my old Android with Metro PCS ran lighting fast with my wifi on, I paid for the unlimited 4GS of service a month and the phone almost never runs on 4GS I live in the Dallas/Fort Worth area in TX I know some places it will and other places it won't but it seriously hardly ever runs on 4GS if it does it's only for a few seconds to a minute, I can still call, receive/send text messages though.

I SOMETIMES HAVE A HARD TIME GETTING  WHAT I NEED BUT I'M JUST LEARNING HOW TO USE IT SOME TIMES I THINK I SHOULDV'E STAYED WITH THE SIMPLE PHONE.

Upon reception of this phone, I absolutely love it, and rave about it all the time.  The honeymoon soon ends when it shuts itself down with no warning, like the other poster said.  Mine is even worse: Not only does it shut itself down, but it also drains itself while it is being charged.  It gets warn and refuses to power on.  It happens a few times already, which irritates greatly.

When you can keep it powered on it works great.  It powers off for no apparent reason.  Then I have to take out the battery to get back on (remove case, back,and battery) which is very annoying.  Not to mention missing family and friends calls or text.  I would not purchase this phone again.  Too late to return for refund.  Thanks a lot Amazon !!!

I lost my Galaxy S3 and didn't have insurance, sucks ok,, but decided to go with a cheaper phone the LG Spirit and after a week with the Spirit I love it more than my Galaxy,, it's faster and less bulky at half the price???!Metro prices are alittle weird, there still selling the LG Esteem for $379, the Connect for about the same and those are sluggish phones?? Hello the Spirit is ten times the phone, way faster, bigger screen and just newer electronics and way cheaper??? highly recomend the Spirt!

The only downside I can see is that the texting is not particularly accurate.  Find myself having to proofread rather carefully, as there is a tendency for wrong letters to appear if one isn't careful about tapping the screen extremely accurately.

The Phone itself is Great, MetroPCS is another story. Just wish is was a different service but the is life

I purchased this phone for my sister and I was very impressed how smooth the software is, for the price is excellent, she had a samsung and it kept shutting down, using the internet is easy, nice big screen and doesnt freeze like her old phone! she loves the phone

wasnt really worth the hype but a great phone. metropcs is a good place for phones but too expensive to get the damn phone...

I ordered this for my girlfriend and she loves this phone.  I am starting to think she loves this phone more than she loves me.

Really nice, has everything I wanted.

I love my phone I only been using for about 2 weeks, s so good. the metr the metro phones  is th is the best. I want  galaxy 3s,at MetroPC. for over 7 year and Metro could give their long term customers better pricing on phones that they do. I Love this phone. I'm rating phone a 4 because I only had for a short time.

Simply the best phone on MetroPCS. Performance, build quality & price point make this a no brainer. Forget that over priced Galaxy S III, the Spirit 4G crushes the SIII in EVERY PERFOMANCE TEST! Don't just take my word for it, youtube video search LG Spirit 4G vs Samsung Galaxy SIII. I was so impressed with it I purchased 2, one for my wife and one for my son. (Amazon.com has the best price on it to boot. WIN, WIN!)

Fantastic LG Spirit 4G LTE android phone BUT beware of any and all MetroPCS Rebate Offers!  I have been "scammed" or denied three (3) phone rebates with the last one a $70 rebate on this phone!  Even if you read and double check the really fine print at the bottom of official rebate form, the Rebate Customer Service employees will invalidate your rebate for any variety of false reasons ie purchased after rebate period, phone activation after rebate period or rebate mailed after rebate period so you call each time & wait online for them to make each corrections...only to finally speak with "Supervisor Rudy" (in the Philippine's call center)  who flat out denies your rebate claim!!  Most all other rebate customer service centers try to help you obtain rightful rebates!MetroPCS does whatever it can to make the process as frustrating as possible and find ways to deny sending the rebate!  If you don't believe me... then do a Google search "metropcs rebate scams/complaints" where you will find thousands of really pissed off former customers! Thanks for reading

Forget Samsung Galaxy. No need to pay $600+ for a phone when LG can do the same job. This thing is fast, beautiful, thin and amazing. Full HD video recording with high quality mic. Great graphics. Awesome battery life. I Play with this phone all day and battery dies at night. 8-10 hours of constant use; both phone internet and the battery still has juice in it.I am happy happy

The phone is amazing, I think everyone will enjoy it. Although the camera isn't that good and also I think I may have bought a defective phone as when I play music sometimes it skips...but besides that really love this phone.

My nephew can't put it down, he has it every time I see him. It is a nic phone for the price!

Good cell phone i was really worried about buying it over the mail ,but no problem got it an its fast easy to usean utube has videos on some of its use

BUY THIS PHONE!  If you have Metropcs and are considering a new phone this is the one.  Metropcs no longer carries it, but offers 2 LG models that are similar to this one, but not nearly as great (check and compare the specs)  I've had my phone for 5 months now and it still looks brand new, is super fast, has a large amount of internal phone memory (very important), and can process with the big boys.

the fone doesnt work at all?!!

This has more than meets the eye,for one it has a snapdragon s4 CPU dual core and its running at 1.5ghz,and its very fast on the benchmarks.I know people with various apple devices that are jealous about the fact they pay some much for so little. I'd rather have a phone made in Korea by the actual mfr.instead of a crapple iPhone made by foxconn in China by people under slave conditions.

If you're looking for a good phone, this is the one. Works like the galaxy s3, the price is also good..

this phone is great. the only issue i have with it that i cannot add apps on the sd card i bought only media files which kinda suck.

This is a five-star phone at 4-star pricing. It's screen size isn't so large (like the Galaxy S III or 4) that you feel like you're carrying around an iPad mini. It's fast, has dual processors, and supports 4G LTE. It has a lot of other features, including adding an internal mini SD Card up to 32 GB.The phone does come with a sim card. Once you get it from Amazon and activate it, you HAVE to bring it to a MetroPCS store to get the 4G sim chip put in. If you don't do that, you'll never get 4G LTE speeds. They basically swap out the sim chip it comes with and put in their own one and activate it with your number. And yes, you can port your landline number to this phone or another cell phone number.People ask me how I got a landline number for my cell phone and I tell them I simply ported it. Because of FCC regulations, they are required by law to port your number whether landline or cell based.Read the specs and compare it to other phones. It won't replace your digital camera, but it won't break the bank either. The online MetroPCS store no longer has them for sale so I'm assuming they are out of stock on them. It's a very sturdy camera with that new gorilla glass for a screen. You can sync it to Windows or Mac (with the proper software), use it as an MP3 player with headphones, watch movies, and more.For about $200 this phone is worth every penny. I see people thumb typing on their iPhones and tsk tsk that they can't swipe 'n' type as Apple locks out all third-party technology that affects "core" technology, e.g., the keyboard. I was able to replace the LG onscreen keyboard with a Swype keyboard and now I can type (swipe) as fast as I type on a regular keyboard.And that is why I prefer an Android phone over an iPhone: It lets me customize it to my tastes, and not the other way around. FYI: I saw the preview of IOS 7 and for a change Apple "borrowed" a lot of ideas from the 'droid phone. That says a lot.

this looks to be a very good phone better than the htc evo design 4g by boost mbl. and it's a lot cheaper than the galaxy s2 which boost has for 329$ for 3g service and subpar sprint coverage and capped data at 2.5gb per month is just does not seem worth it for 55$ + tax a mth to start than drops 5$ for every 6 on time payments to 40$ + tax a mth takes 18 mths but it still is only 3g & 4g wimax in very limited markets where as metro is 4g lte for 60$ a mth for truly ulmtd service in most areas of mich  it  seems worth it for a phone that was designed for android 4.0 ICS and 4g lte service and if you choose to buy it from metro's website or store they offer you a mail-in-rebate so it will be cheaper in your total cost plus with them merging w/t-mobile they will only better in the months & years to come

Its very light in weight which is a plus. Works faster and all around better than the LG Esteem I jus got rid of. Camera is also great. Overall I like it and have been able to put it down since I got it.

Its a nice phone at first but now, I hate it. Had it about 8 months now, the first 6 months were great now it a lot of defects. First heats up 1 or 2 times a week. Shuts off on its own, so when im expecting a call I miss it cause I didnt even realize my phone was off. I make calls and sometime it take like 10 mins to make the call cause i've been trying and it freezes. All of a sudden the person said I pocket dialed them and wasnt even in my pocket. Which means 10 minutes LATER it finally calls. It drains the battery on its own. Im so done with this phone. Getting a new phone soon

This phone blows my iPhone 4 out of the water. Do have to be careful its so light if you aren't careful it could fly out of your hand. Has many great apps and is very easy to use. I would highly recommend this phone at the pricepoint and for a much easier and more fun to work with operating system.

Huge screen.  Phone pairs with car, where in the past others had failed.  It is thin.  It takes pictures rapidly, though I would say the quality of the camera pictures is poor compared to my last two or three phones.  The video is ok.  The flash and flashlight are good.  The battery life is very good for the size of the phone.  For the money, you can't find another phone this size and with these features.  Oh and the 4.5 is much nicer than any 4" screen.  Heck, wish it was 4.8 or 5.

I got a smartphone prior to this and actually sold it because I didn't like it.  Thought the technology was just not for me so I went back to my basic phone.  I bought the LG Motion for my son and he loved it so I thought I'd try the Spirit since I wanted a larger screen.  I just LOVE this phone.  It's not too complicated and still has a lot of features a more advanced user would appreciate.  The keypad is a decent size, even if you have large fingers like I do.

Purchased from another online site that specializes in mobile phones for $229 with free shipping and a $70 mail-in rebate from MetroPCS.  (AFAIK any new LG Spirit should be eligible for the rebate)I had an Esteem which I sold for $175 on CL.  So after rebate, I actually netted $16 in my pocket by upgrading to this phone!  Imagine that - making money by upgrading your phone!When the Spirit arrived, I tried to activate it with *228 but it would not so I called the 888 number. They did get the phone activated, but after a few minutes I noticed it was showing 1X and EV, but never 4G as my Esteem did in the same locations.  I went into a Metro store the next day and was told the Spirit was "too new" for them to be able to help me, but they gave me a # to call "Specialized Support" or something along those lines.  When I called, to my amazement, I was speaking to a real-live person within about 60 seconds!  The very knowledgeable CS rep said that the phone's MEID had not registered as a 4g phone, so something within the system on his side would need to be done.  Five minutes later, I had 4G working on the Spirit. Hats off to excellent customer service from Metropcs.The phone itself is so buttery-smooth and lag free! Its just a joy to use and really puts the Esteem to shame. I'm getting almost a day and a half of battery life - very impressive.The only knock on the Spirit is no HDMI-out.  I tried the DLNA Smart Share program that comes with the phone, but the lag and buffering while viewing phone videos on the big screen tv were unacceptable. Oddly, I could stream video from my PC to the phone with no problems whatsoever.If there was an option for 4.5 stars, that's what I would give, mainly due to the lack of HDMI-out and a very pedestrian camera.  Otherwise, an impressive device!

I did EXTENSIVE research before I decided to spend over two hundred dollars on a phone. It TRULY is comparable to the Samsung Galaxy S3 at least concerning its performance( simply the camera is lower grade at 5mp but is nonetheless a worthy camera, LOVE the feature of saying cheese, whiskey, kimchee,LG, etc. to take pictures, a unique feature of LG). It is FAST and actually clocks in at 1.5ghz, making the 1.2ghz label irrelevant. It is NOT about the processor speed, so much as it is the QUALITY of the processor, and the Spirit is packing a nice dual core SNAP DRAGON. Dungeon Hunter 4 runs BEAUTIFULLY(takes nearly a gig of memory too!). Many people are under the impression that this particular phone will not store apps to the sd, it is not the phone, but the ICS 4.0 and beyond android software that does this, particularly to improve the performance of many applications that suffer from bugging and crashing, much of this is prevented with on board memory, and this phone, unlike many other value priced phones, it has 4.3 gb of internal storage, the sd holds up to 32gb of pictures video and music(make sure to get a class ten or above sd card). The display is clear and has much depth to it. The price was amazing, the store sells this phone for $269 + tax, which roughly comes out to $286, plus a case, puts you at over $300, by purchasing it through amazon (prime) I was able to spend $235, and that included a nicely reviewed, kickstand armored case. This is a FANTASTIC phone. I have loved and trusted Lg for quite some time now ( I own a 10,000btu a/c and 40in 1080 by LG) and am yet ::knock on wood:: to be dissatisfied. Thanks Amazon! Thanks LG!***update*** I have had the phone about three months now,it has suffered only a minor nick at the bottom of the screen, but so far so good. No 4.1 yet, but not necessary at this point. This phone is no longer sold in the Metro Store. The online Metro store is selling the accessories at half the price now(still not great though). Their current Lg phones have half the memory of this one, and are not nearly as sleek or smooth in performance. They come with 4.1, but will run out of memory quickly which is NECESSARY to have multiple apps, as most can no longer be saved to sd. I would get this phone before it is no longer available. For an extra $60/year, insurance is a good thing to have for it, even two years of ins., puts you at half the cost of the phone. With a steady hand and practice, the camera works quite well. The Spirit has been good to me...

Big screen, fast processor and excellent price. I had it for only one month it is kind of hard to give full review. I will review it in the future.

My esteem stopped working after the update and so i decided to go with this phone works a lot better and has better features and cost less than the esteem. the battery life on this phone is also amazing compared to my other phone. sometimes this phone has its glitches but from the past android phones and various companies that make them they all seem to have glitches but nice phone

I really like this phone and the MetroPCS contract. The price for both is reasonable, and I have all the features I need. The only complaint I could make is I don't get great reception at home. However, since the phone connects to my home Wifi network I can browse the Internet even faster on this phone than with 4G, use Skype for calls (I use Skype for over 90% of my calls at home) or use the Metro PCS Joyn service for calls and texts through my home Wifi. Since Metro PCS offers Joyn, which eliminates the reception problem in my block home, I feel fine giving this phone 5 stars. If not for that I would have to take a star away.

Very satisfied- here's why-Battery Life- Good-FAST PROCESSING Power-Good call quality- this is my only phone.-Smooth games/app-Camera is fast and smooth. Not the greatest quality of any picture ever, but hey, I'll keep my $200 extra bucks and use my real camera to take important pics.-Reception good-4G- loads great on the road, loads great at home wifiI've had two other metro smartphones in the past.This blows them out of the water.  essentially it is a powerful computer in your hands with a phone built in.  I can surf chrome on the phone at the same speed as my new laptop.Just buy it- best phone on Metro under $400.

This phone would be great if it didn't freeze up like it constantly does. I've owned three and there all the same, so I know it's the phone and not just the particular handset I had. Others I know had the same problem with this model too.I prefer the LG Motion 4G. It's the smaller version of this phone, but it never gives me trouble.

Well I was with Metro for a long time. Most of my phones with them were new. About half of the new phones from Metro always had some kind of glitch. This one did, past the normal exchange time. I've moved on to another company, and although I know that not all phones with the company may not be bad (i.e. the Galaxy 3, and LG Motion) it's not worth the gamble. I can say the plus about this was the size seemed ideal for me. Not too big, and not to small.

Compared to my previous smart phone, this one is easier to use, has a longer battery life, and more fun features.

Purchased a pair of these phones a week ago and I cannot stop smiling.  I was the owner of the LG Connect (Metro PCS).  When I saw that the LG Spirit was out and offered a newer version of the Android OS along with a bigger and better battery, and oh yeah, the bigger screen as well..............I knew I had to have it.  The battery life on the LG Connect was horrible, so bad that one could not leave home without a charger of some sort in their pocket.  Yeah, that bad.  This phone is really an upgrade, in every way, top to bottom.  I have thrown everything I can at it thusfar and it keeps asking for more.  I love the ability to truly customize many of the features with "Ice Cream", or Android 4.0.  Battery life is amazing, screen is very bright and vibrant, phone is extremely light given it's larger size, and from what I can tell so far this puppy is a "Winner".  The one thing I will mention that did set me back at first was that this phone/OS did not come with a Flash Player integrated like my older LG Connect.  A quick search of the net and this can be fixed with very little effort.  Flash is running and I'm anxious to see what more this thing can do!  Amazon was also extremely fast in getting the phone(s) to us.  Purchased two total and recieved in roughly 2 days.  Way to go Amazon!!!!!  Don't wait, don't overthink getting this phone.  I'm sure that you'll be just as impressed as I am.........  LG came through on this one..........

A few months ago I bought this LG Spirit 4G from MetroPCS. I have not found anything bad about it yet. It has a big, very bright and sharp display, 2 day battery life, and most importantly, a functioning voice dial software - quite a plus after my Samsung Galaxy II with its disasterous, stupid Vlingo software. Also, my hands-free activates in 5 seconds, whereas the Galaxy either misfired or did not start at all. I used to fiddle around with the phone and the hands-free forever (which is dangerous while driving). And incidentally, it is an elegant, slim phone, equal to any other smartphone. W. Zieher

This is a really great phone and considering the price for it, I believe its worth every penny. I upgraded from the Samsung Galaxy Attain( Metro PCS) and I purchased this phone because I wanted to purchase the S3 From Metro PCS but $500 is too much. So I decided to get something that has majority of the features the S3 has for less than half the price. The LG Spirit is a really great phone it works really well and its an ice cream sandwich (Android 4.0)  However, the camera kinda sucks! and that's  why I didn't give it the 5 star rating! I just wish they had made a better camera for this one ;( But overall, great phone!

Better to buy it here then in the store but after of week of use it starts to act out! But other then that its good battery life is what Iam happy of!

If you are not a slave to apple or smart phones in general, this phone is GREAT, at half the price (at least)...  I like the size and thinness of the phone much more than the Iphone...

Switched from a Samsung Galaxy s2 when sprint contract finished. This is an impressive phone for the price. Screen is bright, software good, fit and finish more in line with more expensive phones. Camera is only 5mp but gives good results. battery life is better than expected.  Given much lower cost of service with metro pcs this is an excellent value. Solid mid-to high level phone.

As mentioned, they are basically the same devices but the Spirit has a larger screen with better screen res and I believe the USB port is on the bottom of the phone instead of on the side, plus a few other enhancements.While the specs list this the CPU @ 1.2GHz, Quadrant Benchmark testing shows it to be 1.5GHz.The LG Motion is a great phone and I'm sure I will love the LG Spirit even more with the bigger, better screen.My only wish is that LG would have used an 8MP camera instead of the 5 MP camera, but it takes great HD vids, especially outdoors. Same with pics.Pictures tend to look a bit off in color when viewed on the phone, but once transferred to your PC, the color balance looks better.I like the Motion better than my old iPhone 4S and I'm no longer handcuffed to an expensive 2-year contract, plus I can sell the phone anytime I want since I own it and not the carrier.I will use the $70.00 rebate and will also sell my lightly used LG Motion which will almost pay for the upgrade from the Motion to the Spirit.I'm also saving $40.00 a month by dropping my contract carrier and going with Metro PCS and I'm also getting better service and faster 4G, about 7.5 MBPS D/L, depending on my location.Since I have WiFi at home and at work, I don't use much Data so I can go with the least expensive 4G plan from Metro and if you go over your monthly data allotment, they don't charge you extra - they just throttle your data speed down until the 1st of the month.Either way, I'm saving about $500.00 a year, not to mention the cost of the phone, which I can always sell if I want to upgrade.Win/win.Props to LG and Metro PCSUpdate: After using this phone for the last several months, I love it even more!I've also added a 32 Micro SD card for more music storage and for more video storage capabilities. I also received the $70.00 rebate that was being offered at the time, so my cost for this phone was a little under $200.00 after shipping and Kalifornia taxes. This phone rivals the Sammy S-3 in functionality and in Benchmark testing as well at half the price.This is the best "bang for the buck" smartphone on the market. I blows away my old iPhone 4S which I have since sold, along with my LG Motion which I bought before the Spirit came on the market.I haven't had a single problem with this phone and like the fact that the battery is easy and inexpensive to replace if needed and storage can be upgraded via a Micro SD card. One other thing: "Rooting" the phone is easy and gives the user much more control over the O/S. It also allows you to disable/uninstall much of the LG/Metro "Bloatware" which makes the phone even faster and smoother.I absolutely love this phone - the screen is just the right size as a bigger screen/phone would not fit well in my front pocket.It is also lighter than the LG Motion.Everyone that sees it wants one and several of my friends and co-workers have purchased one after they were "released" from their existing contracts with other carriers.Some products overpromise and underdeliver. Not this one. It lives up to the praise and then some, all at a moderate price and performance wise, rivals phones costing 2x as much.I was going to buy a S-3 when the S-4 came out in anticipation of the cost of the phone being more reasonable, but bought the Spirit while the $70.00 rebate was offered and I'm glad I did as I like the Spirit better than the S-3The only real negative is the camera - it does great outdoors in natural light, but can be a bit grainy indoors.For the $200.00 savings, I can live with a 5MP camera vs. and 8MP camera, and if I want to take good pics, I have a 16MP Nikon Coolpix camera that cost me $100.00 for a refurbished model and it takes fantastic pics.Either way, you can't go wrong with this phone and I can't recommend it highly enough.Good luck and enjoy.

I did a lot of research on phones before I decided on this one. I LOVE it. The loading of pages is quick, the picture is clear. Very cool and functional phone. The screen is large, that is the biggest reason I chose this phone. Would buy it all over again.

One hesitation I had with this item was being able to get it connected being a current Metro customer.  Not many of the reviews really clarified if they were current customers or not.  Very glad I purchased this, as Metro change over from my old phone to this one fairly easily.  I had to call to have it connected manually as the automated wasn't working on the website, and after being disconnected about four times, I finally got through it.  That was the most difficult part of it.  Phone works great, I am very happy with this purchase.

I upgraded to this phone from the Esteem and what a difference. It's pretty quick and responsive. Everything about it is better than the Esteem. I had no problem getting it activated or anything. I like everything about it and would definitely recommend this phone to a friend.

I had an old Zte Score M. this phone is exactly what I needed as and upgrade. I am able to do so much more with this smart phone than with the last and it is so much faster.

Great Phone, Has long battery life and same operationg system as my tablet. Glad I decided to upgrade to LG

This phone is the best phone i have had. Works great. Good price compared to all these expensive phones. Does everything i wanted.

The LG Spirit was the best phone on MetroPcs's CDMA network which covered only 30% of American cities. Now MetroPCS has merged with T-Mobile and the LG Spirit has been replaced by the LG F6.The newer LG F6 uses T-Mobile's GSM and LTE networks which covers twice as many cities as the old CDMA network.  The old CDMA network is being closed down because Metro stores no longer sell CDMA phones.The LG F6 is on sale for just $100 at MetroPcs until March 1st, a bargain price for a 4G LTE phone that runs on the new Metro/T-Mobile network.

Great Value.  I bought two.  We are still discovering functionality all the time so like it more every day.  This was a reasonably priced phone compared to the latest and greatest.  It has big screen which makes texting much easier.

i have metro pcs and the phone works great.its fast on the internet if your in a 4G area.its got a perfect screen size and still fits in my pocket.runs programs nice and smooth.somtimes u hear an echo when u speak but not alot.the only problem im having is that i havnt even had the phone for 2 months and it wont read my sim card anymore.this can be very annoying. idk might take it to get fixed. ill let everyone know. if someone knows how to fix this problem please reply thank u .***UPDATEok so i found out that sometimes SD cards wont work if u switch them from phone to phone. i just bought a new SD card and it works on my new LG Spirit.
