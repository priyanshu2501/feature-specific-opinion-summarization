Dissatisfied. Received the watch. It was programmed in Chinese. The instructions are in Chinese. I do not read Chinese. This phone is useless to me!

I RECEIVED THE CLOCK JUST A FEW DAYS AGO BECAUSE I AM OUTSIDE USA, I GIVE IT TO MY SON AS A GIFT. CELLULAR CALLS HAS NO PROBLEMS, CAMERA AND OTHER THINGS WORKS. I WILL PUT IT A MSD TO HAVE EXTRA MEMORY. EXCELLENT GITF IN MY SON'S BIRTHDAY. A LOT OF FUNCTIONS IN A SMALL WATCH, VERY GOOD PURCHASE.  SELLER SUPPORT WAS VERY HELPFULL.

If you want a toy get this, it does answer calls and make calls but it doesn't do anything else besides time.

Its an amazing watch.....it is exactly what I had purchased and it works great with my T-Mobile service..clear calls wish it was a little easier to text message but that is some of the minors of having a small watch phone but it is amazing to have!

Didn't know the need for a stylis.  Won't Bluetooth to cell phone.  Have to by SIM card to work at all.  Other wise its a cool phone/watch!

Missing some functionalities of a phone, like an app store.  However as a watch, it's wonderful!!!  I LOVE the FM radio function, especially when I'm cleaning :-)

Very happy with the watch. Only gave it a 4 because of the poor camera quality. Neat camera even though. Voice quality and FM radio great. Great buy.

this item looks cool but did not come with the extra battery or a wall charger that was shown when I placed the order. The company was not helpful at all. The phone does not receive pictures. it doesn't  take good pictures and you can't email  at all. Its a good bulky watch.

The accompanying user manual does not make sense, very poor English with lots of grammatical errors.I put in 250 AT&T; minutes and had zero balance in 2 days, The minutes were used up by junk mails and text messages from unknown sources. I have not even been able to use it for calling out and the minutes already ran out.

My child love it!!!it was a. Great gif t the look on her face was priceless I still feel harm inside from that look

I love the watch and have used it for cellphone calls.  I got a H2O sim card that has ATT as the provider and everything works great.  The watch itself brings comments and it is &#34;neat&#34; to have the Dick Tracy effect (but much smaller than Dick's hand radio).  I have had zero problems with it.

I have Sprint as a phone carrier and I have the Samsung Galaxy 4 and I was unsuccessful with syncing the watch with my SIM. What carrier are you all with?

Its a good phone.  Sending and receiving text is good.  But everything else is unsatisfactory. How do you get the internet to work just a little?

I HAVE  NOT GOTTON THE WATCH to even work i have been out of town but need to return this item caus itis not working wnd want a total refund

It's easy to use, it's a lot fun and everything works great, Plus it's a extra phone on my wrist

Ive used watch phone screen could b bbigger to type on otherwise watch phone is great. I want the z1 or the rock toi much money.

Greart watch phone just the gold face ones have sliver band they should match

It's good but the white color is just too much to abstain the dust. I will also like if I can say its unique.

I have tried several carriers and still cannot get this watch activated.....also, everything in in a foreign language i am assuming Chinese or Korean maybe. :-(  My niece was super excited too.

This item is not a watch for full time purpose, but is an excellent cell phone on GSM networks...AT&T or T Mobile. very low internal memory but work around with 2GB card. takes decent photos,plays MP3 and good call quality... Great back up phone.

this type of phone is new to me , I am looking forward to this type of phone usages and stylish look

I must confess I bought this to my daughter Rebecca with a very low expectation. What a surprise ! The cell phone works very well, including the speakerphone. Both sides on the call can hear very well. Yes, text messages are hard to type...but easy to read when received. Camera works but is poor quality, but we really dont care. For less than 50 dollars having voice and text at good quality worth the money. Battery last almost 2 days. Before this phone, it was very hard to talk to my daughter Rebecca on first try, because her phone was always away from her, or in her pocket, in her purse etc. Now it is on her wrist, so she can always take the calls. I am going to buy one more !

To everyone who gave this a terrible review, I think they did not even begin to think logically when they decided to make this purchase. It's a watch phone. You put it on your wrist and make calls and send texts. If you expect anything more than that you are insane. That said, this phone lasts about 3-4 days with light usage and about 8 hours with really heavy usage such as playing music on the speaker from this phone for a few hours at a time.The texting feature on this phone is a lot more awesome when you really look at it as well. The phone doesn't come with a stylis but you can easily just use a ball point pen as one and wipe the screen after you are done with the text. I fell in love with this phone not only for the price but also for the ease of use and the fun factor.For the durability, that was the only problem I had, but to be fair, I am exceptionally hard on the watch. I have dunked it in the ocean, smacked it into the underside of my car, placed some hellish pressure through my riding jacket, and sweated all over it while running. Through all this the only problem I have with it is the power button is unresponsive when the phone is turned off and needs to be placed on a charger to turn the phone back on.I also have the ring tone set to the metal gear solid codec. Too bad you can't change the message tone to a custom tone though.

This watch phone works great!  It arrived on time and with all of its accessories.  The phone has excellent signal and calls can be answered with its built-in speaker or by using a Bluetooth set.  It's easy to make and receive calls.  I find it especially convenient to use while driving or skating.  It's light weight and comfortable.  I strongly recommend this watch.

Really big. Features not great but the FM radio is cool. I wish it had more features and easier to operate

Bought it as a giftffor someone, and he liked it so much, he called to ask about how he could get another one.

It is a really good idea to wait till the technology is a little more complete.Phones before flip phone are more complete than this phoneIt doesn't even have a calculator.you have to set the clock every time you turn off the watch because it has little memory. Do your homework before buying this.

Early last week I bought the Cell Phone Watch as a personal gift. I received it quickly, and within hours I had it working. Yes, the manual could use a lot of rewriting, but the watch is pretty much self explanatory. The cell phone works great on the T-Mobile network. The sound quality is good for such a small device. However, the earplugs that came with the phone were the wrong ones, and there was no spare battery, as advertised. So, I contacted PGD Group, the sellers, by e-mail and they responded right away. They were understanding, and said they would send out the correct parts. Today, only 4 days later, I received the spare battery and the correct earplugs. I am a happy camper, and all thanks to the responsiveness of the PGD Group. This is a very inexpensive watch, that works well, and yet they took the time to make things right. I highly recommend them if you are considering this type of purchase.

It doesnt turn on or charge, so It can't be used as a either a phone or a watchNow I need to go buy a phone that works

the watch was a cool gift for my brother.. itmet my expectations and was a good choice for a gift

I am in a wheelchair and thie phone works great for that. It's always with me and not lost. Could use more home citieson west coast.

this is the best i have seen need one that has wi fi and games and the camera needs some work.

i JUST RECEIVED THE WATCH, SO FAR EVERYTHING WORKS LIKE IT IS SUPPOSED TO EXCEPT THE RADIO,WE Will SEE HOW LONG IT HOLDS UP TO THE USAGE. OVERALL I LIKE IT AND WOULD RECOMMEND IT. LIKE MANY I READ THE REVIEWS BEFORE I BOUGHT IT AND HAD SOME CONCERNS,BUT MOST OF THEM WERE ON THE PLUS SIDE.

Delivery was less than a week.I ordered three, two blk/gold and one white/gold, for me, son and daughter (Christmas). Really nice cell phone watch, for the price. Put in my T-Mobile sim card and worked for making calls. Relatively easy to set up. I like the black w/gold. Very light weight. Reason for three stars: The only down side,so far, is that the speaker is quite low, unless you use the the supplied head set or have a Bluetooth, which I have. Made a couple of calls and they heard me clearly. Time will tell if they hold up.

The watch phone looks good, is lightweight and feels comfortable on the wrist. I mainly bought it for an MP3 player to use on morning walks since it had bluetooth and was located on the wrist. It seemed like a great price, but reality got in the way. The bluetooth activation is buried several layers deep on tiny menus so it is awkward to access and requires tiny fingers or nails. The sound quality was clipped. Also, the MP3 player didn't remember position like many/most MP3 players-- instead it started over each time. It wasn't useful to me for listening to podcasts or audio lectures. I gave away the watch phone after a week. Others may desire different features and have better luck than me.

Sent it back because it didn't work as advertised. You get what you pay for, and that not necessarily a bad thing. I mean for the price you have a very nice toy, but the feature I wanted most  just didn't work.

Got it for my younger bro. Cool, fun gadget. But not much practical as such. Good for kids perhaps 9-12yr type.

the watch is in low quality the leg is torn card memoir is not working the tactile is low quality

Well I love it and the color is great for me becauseI like Pink and Blue. just like product

It works great once you find a compatible carrier.  Hands free audio is a little low, but can be heard.

It worked as advertised, but a month into using it..the touch screen stopped functioning.  I loved the ease of use..but it could be a lot more robust..it broke down too easy and really wasn't suited for everyday use.

I did not really buy this item for myself and person who I bought it for really loves it. It has all the required features and is as described and for its value it's great.

The quality is quite good. Works in Europe. Watch is easy to use for older people. Not so good instructions.Creditable supplier

didnt know needed separate sims card from phone. so trying to see how to get it working,hope soon,thanks for good pricesatleast

I bought this for someone it looks nice and everything but reading the instructions it say it needs a stylus pen to use and there is none that comes with the product which means i will have to go but it else where. that is not good. plus its now $20 less i got it for $59.99

Because it doesn't work no working anything not the touch screen not the anything I couldn't get anything working it sucks

used only once since purchase and will be willing to reture if you can accept it i dont mind losing some money

nice watch but the battery life is not good, even when not in used battery life is two hours with battery life is so short that when you change battery you have to reset everything.

It arrived as stated, but the quality and price were not the definition of what I wanted, plus the battery started to smoke on the first recharge.

It is a cool watch I just think it is a little too big. I wish I wouldn't have paid 70 dollars for it. But I though that prevail one on would really like it. Which she did but I myself think its too big.

my first impression..."cheap", and it is quite large.  however, it may be worth the nominal price just for the entertainment value of the instructions.  such as "no exposing the watch phone under the sunrise or the place with smog and dust".  got an h20 sim card so will see if I can intuitively figure all this out and update at a later time.  wish me luck****updated 4/11***purchased h20 sim card for pennies on amazon, inserted in back, and went on h20 website and had new account setup and my son's phone number ported from tracfone within 24 hours without a hitch.  as for the phone....it is a bit of a novelty and not practical for heavy use.  I got it because my son WILL lose any electronic device he can get his hands on....so this was as close to "attached" and "disposable" as I can get.  however, I cannot get the music to play.  inserted a micro sd that had music on it, couldn't get it to 'save to my music" like the instructions said.  tried a blank and downloading from the computer and still haven't quite figured it out.  keeps saying "empty"...so I'm apparently not understanding something in file management.  the instructions are not informative.  for anyone looking for a stylus...it is in the watch.  a small silver button on the lower right.  if you pull on it, it is a telescoping stylus.  I guess I am a dinosaur because at first I thought it was an antenna.

I gave this to my son who's always leaving his phone at home or is always misplacing it. He never leaves home without his watch, though, so I thought this was a great idea! He loves it, especially seeing people's reactions when it rings and he answers it. He broke his charger after a couple of weeks, maybe he yanked it too hard, I don't know. But I contacted Amazon and they gave me the email address of the seller and the guy I talked to, Jack, was very helpful. Awesome customer service!

Surpassed my ideas for this, it works good for me. Put in a pay as you go sim card and was using it. Could use a better speaker, but for the size. you can use ex earbud, person your calling hears just like regular home phone. Don't have to pair with anything.

This review is for the product not for the company the company did very well with delivery.The watch on the other hand For kid is okay. I wouldn't recommend it unless you have a very small fingers.

Excelent

I bought 2 of these watch phones from you guys but didn't receive a charger in the pink/gold watch phone box. I just bought a white/gold one an hopes dat it is properly packaged and sent to me. Otherwise the phone functions tremendously nice and I jus have to borrow chargers to charge my watch phone.

i bought this for someone as gifft. So far it is working well. So far so good. It is very pretty

the watch as an idea is good but the quality is so poor they need to improve this a lot.

I received this as a gift however I was looking into these for a while now.One of my biggest problems was trusting the workmanship and reliability of these devices as an actual alternative to a regular cell. Battery life was a concern but I was surprised that I didn't charge it for 2 days and still had one bar of battery life on the meter with bluetooth enabled. Workmanship is &#34;plastic&#34; enough said.Bluetooth works correctly however unlike a traditional phone which allows you to trust a device and no longer prompt, this one does every time my car want's to connect. So that's one annoyance of this product but I wasn't expecting much for it's price.Screen is responsive and includes a hidden stylus in the band for you to use for when browsing a contact list.Other than that you shouldn't treat this as anything special and more like an old Kyocera (basic phone). Buy a bluetooth headset if you are really considering it as a current phone replacement.Call quality is good to ok.On T-mobile America.

Great watch. Impresses all your friends and comes with earphones. Never got to use the phone feature or anything else except the calendar before some jerk hit it and broke it. Cracked the screen. May be buying another one tho!

This is the best watch i have ever owned..I put in an 8 gig card into it and use it as a jump drive and listen to the radio..text and take phone calls ..Where can you do that with any phone .People think it is a watch until it rings and i answer it or get a text message and the look  on there face is worth it also

I gave this watch/phone only 2 stars because it was put together poorly. The idea is great and I do own a different brand of one that I use every day. This one although looks good, does not work well. The buttons stick all the time and I found myself using my pocket knife to pry the buttons lose. The quality of this product is shoddy at best. Remember though that its quality is no reflection on Amazons service or quality. I have been purchasing items from Amazon for many years and have always been treated top notch.

Very nice have no problem everything work well Text calls Bluetooth call video camera all works great and ptice is fair

HiI purchased this for my daughter, she loves it. I had tried purchasing a watch phone another time but we couldn't get it to work. This one worked as soon as we put the sim card in. Its very nice looking too.dee

I got this watch and it just dos not feel right on my wrist i would rather have appledevlop a Iwatch that would be better

is a emprese that meets the promise of the page,fulfilled the time offered,,is an interesting team for the kind of technology that was used

Works for my 10 year old.. and he has not lost it once but he forgets to charge it sometimes.....

It a nice flashy watch for everyone to notice! White is beautiful but the rubber like watch bands seem to get dirty easily and am unable to clean it off. No android or anything like new phones. Unable to use internet since it is very small. Discovered a tiny stylus pen on its side which helps you key in what you need. It also has a writing tool that you can scribble your digits or letters on its whole screen and it will key it in for you. Camera and video are not very good, but fun to show off. Fm radio has almost no reception. I connected it with striaght talk and did not have any trouble with it at all. Also some calls seem to have very little volume which you need to hold it to your ear. Never found the cause of that?

ProsCoolness alone gets a starConvenient especially when working out or bikingNo need to connect to another phoneConsThe buttons are really hatd to press with my handsThe menus are not intuitoveIt is a bit bigger on my wrist.The audio player takes a while to select a song/ffwd etc. since the menu is buried.Updated -- [ 9/26/13 - upped a star after using it. ]The bluetooth works fine with Nokia headset.  I was using JABRA earlier and the music quality was horrible. I cannot figure it out. The el-cheap, Nokia headset does not drop signals like the JABRA. Could be the BlueTooth version. Still, it's an improvement.Anyhow, this was a life saver when I working out - my phone almost fell out of my pocket on the floor the last time -- this thing was on my wrist all the time. No worries.

When to get the watch notice in the box it doesn't have a sim card so with out the sim card the watch itself is just pointless especially when you might have a phone in the first place so before you place your order add a sim card to the cart to avoid foolishness when the watch arrives

Do you ever see those cheapy ten to twenty dollar prepaid cell phones?  The one's that have just 6 to 8 icons on it to do basic tasks like phone, text, web, photos, music and alarm clock?  Well take the guts out of that phone and put it into a circular plastic enclosure and attach a wristband to it.  You now have that same basic cell phone on your wrist.  That is what this wetch is.I was amazed that I now have a touch-screen phone on my wrist as I love watches.  I got happy as MP3's started playing loudly from the watch and out of the built-in speaker...I got even happier when I took my T-Mobile SIM out of my regular cell phone and stuck it into this watch phone.  Made calls with no problem...I thought this would be the best watch phone ever...until I found out that the browser can only load ONE webpage.  It loads the mobile version of Google.  If I click on any link, it tries to load and says "Insufficient memory".  I tried going to [...](a mobile weather site), and it cannot even load that.  I researched the device's hardware.  It has 20KB of onboard storage.  Note: that's 20K - not 20 MB or 20 GB...20KB!  I had installed an 8 GB microSD in it but that didn't help.  There is no way of configuring the browser to use the 8 GB SD card as cache.  The browser is 99% useless (or 1% useful).Sadly, the advertised 1.3 MP camera can only take pictures at 160x120 and 120x120 with or without the SD card installed.  There is no option to take pictures at 1280x1024 (1.3MP).  I checked every option in there and cannot adjust the resolution to anything higher than 160x120.  On the other hand, when I select the video recorder option, it actually lets me record at 320x240 at its highest resolution.  It does record on to the SD card...why can't the stupid browser use the SD card instead of its onboard 20 KB?I really think I was given a different model watch phone because my broswer don't work past one webpage and it can only do 160x120 = .019200 MegaPixel pictures.  So why didn't I return it or ask for another one...laziness...plus I do like this phone and it works.  I didn't want to gamble by returning and getting one where the camera and browser works but the phone or something else won't.  Plus, I have an HTC Amaze that already has a browser and 8 MB camera on top of an Olympus E-PM1.Cell Service you ask?  Here's the summary...I have tried THREE different SIMS.1.  T-Mobile SIM taken from my HTC Amaze...works great.  Cell phone calls are good.  Texting is a bitch because you have to use a zip tie, toothpick or a very thin stylus to type on the Qwerty keyboard on a 1 1/2 inch screen.  To get the browser setup, you have to go into the settings and add the service "fast.tmobile.com".  Again, it will load one webpage google.com. If you click on any link, it will say "Insufficient Memory".2.  I signed up for Consumer Cellular.  Their stupid $10 a month plan includes ZERO minutes.  Really?  Then why pay $10?  I had to pay $15 for the 150 minutes plan.  A $2.50 add-on gets you 100 texts and little web data.  $5 gets you 500 texts and like 100MB of data.  Careful, even without your SSN, they pull your entire credit report.  It showed up on my credit report and caused my score to go down due to "Too many inquiries".  Anyway, they shipped me a free SIM.  I installed it.  The calls and texts went through ok.  After researching for a couple of days, I found a much cheaper plan...3.  The new H20 wireless.  H2O Wireless (formerly O2 Wireless, not to be confused with O2 of Europe) is a United States-based prepaid GSM phone and Internet service. It is the brand of mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) Locus Telecommunications via AT&T;'s network.  Basically, it's a nickel for text and phone calls.  Pay $10, get 200 minutes.  Pay $20, get 400 minutes.  Or simply pay $100 and get 2000 minutes to use in 12 months (about $8.33 a month).  I had to pay $9.99 for the SIM.  Bought it at the BestBuy store rather than waiting for it to be shipped.  I installed the Dual-size SIM into the phone.  Careful, it is a microSIM inside a full size SIM.  Try not to break it out of the full size SIM or you will be stuck with a microSIM that won't fit the watch phone.  I added $10 to my account and had 200 minutes to use.  Made calls and sent a couple of texts.  Works great.In conclusion:Calls and Texts: Work Great if you don't mind the extremely small qwerty keyboard on a tiny little screen.Camera: Mine won't go past 160x120 on stills and 320x240 on video.FM Tuner: Works great...as long as you have the proprietary USB headphones plugged in.  These ARE NOT mini USB earphones.  It is a proprietary port.MP3 player works great.  Surprisingly good sound out of the on-board speaker.Touch-screen works fair to good.  Even after calibrating, it can be slightly off.It has calendar, alarm, Tasks and Ebook reader.It's got "QQ" that is only in Chinese.  Don't know what it's used for.Waterproof??? Hell no!  I forgot to take it off once when I went into the shower and it froze.  I had to remove the battery and stick it in one of those "Wet Cell Phone repair kits" I bought at the dollar store.  I let it dry for a day and it worked after that.I would have given it 5 stars if the camera and browser would have worked.  Still a good watch.  Maybe a firmware update or something will fix it.***UPDATE AS OF 10/13/13***It's been several months and my phone watch still is working great.  I charge it to 100% and it stays on for 4-6 days on standby with little usage.H2OWireless is now only $3.34 a month.  Pay $10 and get three months of service or 200 minutes...whichever comes first.  Since this should be an emergency phone or backup phone, you won't hit the 200 minutes for three months.  And if you don't hit your 200 minutes, the next $10 will add the 200 minutes and carryover your non-used minutes.Someone asked about buying a backup USB cable...well, since this uses a proprietary USB cable, you will have to buy another watch if you want another cable.  I tried buying one of those Watch/Phone USB cables that they claim work with most watch phones.  It arrived and looked way different than the photo showed.  This cable is not miniUSB or microUSB so don't lose your proprietary cable.

I bought this as a gift but haven't heard back from the giftee to find out if it actually works or not.

it was very nice worked very well the only problem is that is didn't come with the invoice so i ended up having to pay more in the long run -_- but it worked really well but plz work on that invoice problems

i like the facing of the product, only that the material should have been a little more in lather form. It's good. I like it.

Strap is too weak, broked during 1 month. No chance to repair.Not worth buying at all.Rate = zero

They can't even be hook up at metro So what can i do instead of wasting my money is there a number i can call

Has many functions but still not like smart phone. Its good for kids or some one  cant answer his phone easily while he working or driving  so he press the watch speaker then talk .

It works perfect for me and my niece who is twelve. She still wants a regular phone but will get one for Christmas. In the meantime this watch phone makes and receives clear calls, takes grainy pics and texts just fine.  My niece has to wait on the corner every weekday for the schoolhouse alone at 7:00 am.  I am able to call her...talk to her and know that she made it on the bus safely. I told her that she had to stop sneaking and sending me pics and texts while in class. None of her teachers know it is a phone.  It is kinda big on her little wrist,

This is the coolest watch ever you can take it to school and all your friends think its the coolest thing ever and your teachers don't even know its a phone

The watch has everything it's really cool but it may be a bit bulky but it can be used every once in a while

i like the phone but its screen is blank and i couldnt use it, i just shipped it back. am kinda dissappointed though cos i was hoping to order it in a large quantity ealrier but am having a rethink

i got this for my seven year old twins for the holidays  and they absoloutley love it !!i am so happy with it.great for kids all agesget it

IT is good but a little rain and it doesn't work anymore. You get what you pay for. I would have loved it if you could just synchronize with the computer, but you have to enter all the numbers in it. It is good just to show or as a backup phone, but not as a main phone/watch

Watch gains time. About 30 mins every hour.  Everything else works fine. Cannot connect to the internet . Need a manual.

No fault of Amazons', but the watch did not come with SIM card or AC adapter. Could not use. Amazon did refund and will reorder another in the near future. Amazon went above and beyond expectations.

Nice phone, looks great just what I order. Great price and happy customer possible order more in the future thanks again.

The watch working great, easy to set up and using. Only it just accept the old sim card, it is OK.The battery if you remove or forget to recharge the battery. Need to reset everthingOverall the watch is good for fun and nice

My 11 year old daughter got this phone for the wow factor of having such a cute watch and phone all in one, but turns out that the watch does not keep accurate time!!!! Very unexpected that that should be the issue, but it is a handy way of carrying the phone without needing a pocket or bag.

I purchased 2 of these watch phones about a month ago, one pink for my wife (her favorite coller), a black one for myself. I was looking for a fairly inexpensive, basic cell phone to use as a backup, due to the fact that our regular cell phones seem to ALWAYS need to be on a charger, and also because my wife has a bad habit of leaving her cell phone on the charger in the car or at home and not having it with her when she needs it, or I am trying to reach her by phone (we both have android smart phones). Based on the product description these phones seemed to fit the bill perfectly, especially since they were wearable so they would be convenient to always have with you, and did not scream cell phone. Being a watch was also a plus as we were relying on our cell phones as a watch previously. The Dick Tracy Gee Whiz factor did not hurt either!I have to admit based on the mixed product reviews my expectations were NOT too high and if it were not for the fact that I am a long time Amazon customer and I had the protection of ordering through Amazon in case their was a problem I probably would not have taken a chance and ordered them. My concerns were completely unfounded! These watch phones are AWESOME!!! I am blown away and extremely pleased with them! They look great (a bit on the big side, but I am a big guy so no problem their, my wife is very petite, so she wears hers a bit loose but looks like a bracelet watch. My wife is very picky and skeptical about how things look and gadgets in general, but she loves hers as well!). They were very easy to set up and are easy to use and work GREAT! I could not be more pleased with my purchase! I am so pleased I am ordering another one, this time the stainless steel model as it better suites my style.The call quality is very good (people on the other end of my calls actually tell me I sound better then when I use my smart phone). The MP3 player works great, sounds a bit tiny but more then acceptable, the camera and video are VGA quality, but as long as you mange your expectations and know they are not HD they are perfectly useable when you have not other camera available. TXT works very well also. I have not tried getting on the web with them or using the FM radio, and probably never will. I have also not yet tried the Bluetooth so I cannot comment on that either. The battery life surpasses my expectations, needing recharging only every few days with marginal cell use. If you are looking for a stylish, fun, practical, easy to use basic phone with a little Gee Whiz factor you will love these watch phones! One warning, be prepared if you use it in public to get LOTS of questions about it as EVERYONE loves them and are curious about them and want to know where you got it!A few things to be aware of;They screen and keypad are very small. The watches come with a small stylus that fits in the band, and you will probably need it for the initial set up as well as for texting. I have big hands, and can still manage to dial and make calls without the stylus, but definitely have to use the stylus to TXT.The product description says it will support a 8GB memory card  but the box says 4GB. I could not get the 8GB card to work and had to buy 4GB Micro SD cards which work just fine!The phones ONLY work on  GSM cellular networks. They require a SIMM card for your cellular provider. In the US you can only use cell phone service provided by ATT, or T Mobile or resellers of their service like H2O. If you are not sure ask if your cell provider uses SIMM cards. If they don't you cant use these phones on their network.The phones are very easy to set up as long as you are comfortable with what you are doing. Pop off the back, insert a SIMM card from your chosen cellular provider, insert a 4GB memory card. Put the back/battery back on, turn the watch on/ set the time and date, activate with your cell phone provider and your are done and ready to make and receive calls. That easy. about 10 minutes or less!We purchased both our phones through Amazon from PGD Group. I can not speak for other vendors, but their customer service is outstanding! They stand behind their products, and make sure the customer is taken care of and happy! If you buy from them you will not go wrong!

Is sucks couldn't put any sim card to get it work I wish I can get my money back I think amazon should refund my money even the watch always one hour to fast.......

i recieved it an was all excited bout phone till i install sim card to find out that screen is locked an it wont respond to touch.so bascially people can call me but it wont touch to link to bluetooth...

Had issues with the phone. It came to me with some glue around the face & cheaply made. The company was good with solving the problem. You get what you pay for.

I wouldn't recommend this watch (i'm not even sure if it is a watch, really). It's ridiculously useless and it breaks after a few hours of wearing it, but that's the best part about it. Since now, you will be spared the frustration of resolving absolutely nothing by wearing this device, again, whatever it is.Good luck with that.

so I bought it thinking just new technology and it pretty cheap so bought it and it blew my mind its really a phone in a watch and its a decent size one defect you really need to buy a pointer for the touch screen but good for teens in high school you can never loose your phone

He feels like a spy or super hero with his fancy new phone.  Only complaint is that he didn't like the earphones that came with the phone.

It works perfect for me!! Don't understand the bad reviews!! The WATCH is unlocked for phones that are on a GSM network like T-Mobile or AT&T which means you have to have a SIM CARD. The sound quality on phone calls is great, and the watch really can do a lot. Love the pink color, But the watch is a lot more bulky then I thought it would be but that's ok just wear a little loose and it looks like a bracelet. DEFINITELY SATISFIED WITH THIS PURCHASE.

this was such a waste of money it worked for 1 day afterwards it stopped working!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  i truly hate this product
