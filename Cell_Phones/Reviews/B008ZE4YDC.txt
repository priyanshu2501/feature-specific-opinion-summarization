phone is ok no memory even with a memory card keeps telling me memory is low and need to delete items but it will due for now

I have ADHD and really need something to hold my life together; the Palm Pilot used to do that, but they are extinct. So I looked for an inexpensive smart phone that I could adapt to my needs. The Coolpad has worked nicely in that capacity.Note: I cannot comment on the Coolpad as an actual phone. As soon as it came out of the box I removed the sim chip which completely isolates it from the cell phone network. Wi-Fi meets all my data needs and I use a simple voice cell phone to talk & text for almost half the cost of the data plan.I'm not going to bore you with everything the phone does, Lots of others are covering that.For me the main selling point of this phone was the BIG screen. It was the thing that kept buyer remorse at bay.Why remorse? This thing only has 180 MB of ram!Before I got this thing I thought 256 MB was puny. Now, ... oh my oh my. If you're not familiar with the issue, the ram dictates how many apps you can ~install~ on the phone. That's right: not run at once, but install. All the rest of the memory is just storage for data. If you install too many apps the device starts to slow down. At the moment I'm using 163 MB and I'm constantly getting a dialogue box asking if I want to delete some apps.I like the phone. It fit well in my hand, it's fallen out of my pocket several times and is none the worse for wear. It works pretty well and is fairly quick. But if I'd realized how small the ram was at the time of purchase, big screen or not, I'd probably have spent my money on something else.

S***tiest phone you could ever buy. Not a day goes by that I don't cuss this phone out. battery life sucks, it goes from 50% to 1% in a matter of minutes. Not reliable at all, always runs out of battery. So hard to text, always freezes. My pictures and contacts and messages all had to be deleted 3 freaking times because my phone stopped working and I had to reset it. S*** phone don't ever buy!  Don't care how broke I am I'm saving up for an Iphone.

When i got this phone I was used to typing on my little LG.  I had a lot of trouble with the keypad, but had to cut my nails1  First I had to take it back to reset, cause it would not react at all to the back or home button.  It still freezes up and I have to wait. But for the price and rebate this was a good buy.  The battery time sucks. it lasts about 4 hours, so I have to carry charger.  I am still a beginner at all this stuff, but this is a good learning phone for me, and soon as my rebate comes, I'll be even happier

Laggy. Not the best phone for Internet usage. Even opening my messages and contacts is laggy. Making calls takes longer than my Samsung Freeform ever took. Phone constantly tells me I have no room for another app when I only have about 5. Comes with many predownloaded apps nobody really needs or wants. But it's a phone, and it does its job. If my Samsung Freeform could download apps, I'd switch back.

this phone is horrid. dies all the time. even if i havejust charged it..camera only takes black and white photos because it is jammed on that setting. a true piece of junk!

I've had my Coolpad for over a year and i have to say that it is the best phone I have ever purchased. It is a well made Android and all the features work well. it is easy to navagate and the screen is large with vibrant colors.  Picture snapshots come out nice for a cell phone and the texting is great, especially when using the finger sliding feature. I actually have no complaints... my experience with this phone is great and I am quite pleased with it... compared to the aggravations I have had with some of the other well-named brands.  If you are looking for a simple phone that is just as fancy and sleek as your high end smartphones... this droid is for you. I love it!

Don't waste your money. Worst phone I've ever had, doesn't work with FB texting is horrible. Screen is dull and dim, garbage

Coolpad Quatro Works Really Well. I Bought For My Daughter And She Is Very Pleased, Which Makes Me Pleased. Glad I Found This deal

I just got this phone(2/14/13.It is 4g i get great signal for where i live.I would check to see if you live where it covers. But as for all the people that says its junk that's because of them not knowing how to use it they probably install a lot of crap that's makes there phone lag. But camera isn't that good.Its a good phone overall. Its fast and responsive. When you have a little bit of stuff installed.

Love this phone, great speed and works great!!! The reviews on this phones were very misleading, I have had no problems what so ever and acually am very satisfied!

This item was the worst thing I have ever bought from amazon. The phone worked but I could not activate it because of no sim card. I did know that it did not come with one but I was told you can get one from the mobile phone store so I got the phone. When I went to the phone store to activate the phone, the man working told me to activate the phone I must have a sim card. So with no simcard I can NOT use the phone. This has made me Very Mad about buying this because I spent good hard earned money on a peice of worthless junk. This goes out to people who are thinging about buying used phones from amazon......DON'T DO IT

Disappointed with performance . My phone dials numbers while laying on table ,all by itself ,when I am not using it . The battery is constantly discharging . Also has a terrible sound system that sometime shrieks while talking like it might have a busted speaker .Guess I expected better since I upgraded from LG Imprint  to 4G . It is an attractive phone but , the only good thing I like is the size and of cause , the price .

I bought this phone not to long ago... for $346, Which was a stupid thing on my half.. I have had 4 replacement phones! Ans now my battery Just literally exploded in my phone. The phones processor is to powerful for the battery to operate on so it works harder at working and eventually the phone says screw it and quits working. I wouldn't buy this phone again. I wouldn't recommend this phone to anyone. This phone should be on recall and the people who bought it should get their money back!

Well the phone it self is really nice dont expected to be a galaxy ir iphone because is not.Been with this phone with 5 months very satisfied WITH THE PHONE.I pay $70 a month for "unlimited data".I have to start with metropcs it sucks just to horrible.I heard from people saying that metro sucked but i thought come on cant be that bad.I wen and connect this phone an i was done I rushed ro download something from google play speed was about 456kb/s not the fastest but in the previous i haf verizon and it downloaded at 4.7MB/s .of course it was a huge difference.after like 1 month thats where every thinng start tl went wrong the speed was of 70 kbs the fastes couldn't even watch a video on youtube without it stopping every 10 seconds.the 4g arrows on top the green one only that would turn on so that the ment only upload speed was on and that hapenned around for about 2 every 8 times each one for about 20 minutes so for 3 hours basically.the other thing was that the the 4g letters on top would disapear for about 30 minutes and this was all days so i couldnt actuallly  get anything because either it was to slow or the 4g was failing and like oncw in a while the it would work normally for about 5 minutes.I went to comolaint than i soon realized thats why everyome hates metro. Because thats their service.But the phone with wifi works really good plays all the the games that the olaystore has to offer. I have a galaxy s3 now om verizon again 5gbs of data its more than enough for 1 month and it works like if i had wifi.I gave this review 5 stars because im reviewing the phone not the service i still have it works nice with wifi.I dont really use it no more .Dont with metro for 4g honestly you pay $70 a month just o get basically 1x service or worst

My wife needed a new phone as her old Samsung Admire was having issues with the Charginr port... again. She doesn't like spending alot of money but liked the size and resolution of the screen on my LG Connect. I saw the coolpad and thought it would be perfect. I also saw the 1 star reviews and complaints here and wasn't so enthusiastic anymore. We decided to go to the local Metro PCS store and look at it anyhow.Luckly, the owner had one that was already open so we could get a hands on. Initialy, I was confronted with sluggish typing when trying out texting. Then I noticed that it was not the basic keyboard but something else like Swype. I switched it to the default gingerbread android keyboard and it was smooth as could be. We decided to go ahead and buy it because with the $50 rebate, there was no way you could beat the price for features.So.... once we got it home, I had to mess with it and test it out. First off, there is no root process for this phone yet that I could find. I was shocked however when the metro pcs garbage just let me uninstall it with no issues. The phone feels about as responsive as my son's Samsung Attain so we ran an AnTuTu benchmark on both phones. The Quattro's CPU scored a tiny bit better than the Attain and the GPU scored a tiny bit lower. Now remember that the Quattro has a higher resolution and therefore the GPU has to process 2.5x the pixels as the attain. That means that the Quattro will feel just about the same as the attain from a performance standpoint but you get a much higher resolution screen. Testing with a few games proved the assumption to be true. The attain was only a TINY bit smoother on games. Notmal phone and app perfromance seemed the same to me on both phones.The screen: I have seen the quality of the screen blasted on many reviews. I think it looks pretty darn good. Putting it side by side with my LG connect, I notice that the connect looks a little more natural and has a better viewing angle range and gets a little bit brighter. Having said that, I still thing the screen on the Quattro looks good. I will also say that I think that this Quattro screen looks better than the best 480x320 screen ever made. Also, for some people the screen size and resolution can be very important. For me it is as often for my job, I will need to access standard formatted web pages while out and about. The 800*480 resolution makes a world of difference.The call quality is pretty good. The signal is strong and the microphone picks up voices well. The earpeice speaker is a little muffled but was fine for me. My wife didn't like it too much till I turned the volume up. Speaking of volume, I had read on one professional review that the earpeice volume did not get loud enough. I'm not sure if that was an early model of this phone and they have since fixed the issue but I can say that my wife's gets pretty loud when turned all the way up.We haven't tested the battery life yet as my wife has gotten in the habbit of always putting her phone on a charger.So, in conclusion we have had no lockups, no reboots and no sluggish behaviour. Of course, that is after I changed to the stock keyboard and removed the MetroPCS apps. I can't think of any other phone that you can get at this price (Especially with the current rebate) with these features. As I meantioned earlier, it performs like a Samsung Attain but with a larger screen.Update: My wife started complaining that the phone was getting sluggish again. Then she started getting low memory warnings and realized that she had loaded quite a few programs that stay active. After removing a couple that she really didn't even use, the phone is back to responsive again.I saw somewhere on a professional review site that coolpad had stated that they had taken their time with the radio part of the phone and it does show. Often, the coolpad will have one bar more signal than my Connect and my son's attain while we are all in the same car. That was driving through the middle of florida and often meant the difference between getting reliable data and not. The signal strength on this phone is pretty darn good.Update April 2013: There is a root process for this phone now! Still no Clockwork Recovery that I'm aware of yet but at least you can finally root this thing.

I have had this phone for almost a year now, and it works just as well as the day I bought it.  This really is a great phone at an even better price!The phone is a tad light on internal storage (not talking SD card, but actual internal phone memory).  But if you are expecting tons of internal memory at this price, you need to get your head out of the clouds.

2014-05-30 ... I've owned at five (5) of the Coolpad Quattro 4G LTE Android Phones.  I know the User software interface, and like the phone's ergonomics.  The first cellphone was a casualty of an accidental Starbuck's Coffee bath.  The second cellphone had the screen gradually die, which was understandable with about 9 months virtual &#34;non-stop&#34; display time (24/7).  The third one is working great.  The product arrived &#34;as new&#34; with the complete package (battery charger and user manual).  The fourth and fiftth cellphones are safely locked away in my office desk for future use when there's another &#34;owner/equipment failure event&#34;.

THIS IS GARBAGE!I use to own a Droid Incredible 2 on Verizon Wireless & O.M.G. I use to complain about the stupidest things that mean NOTHING to me anymore. I went over my data usage due to INSTAGRAM and my dad cut my phone off & gave me this! SMH I cannot believe this is even called a phone!!Apps: My phone won't let me download any apps permanently. I have to download (use for a few weeks, maybe a month) and then delete it!  I can't use Instagram at all!SIM card: It started acting up 2 weeks after I got the phone. -_- Deleted 2 weeks worth of pictures.Battery life: This is what makes me say this isn't a phone. I leave my house and get to school (takes me 1 hour and 15 minutes, if that) & my phone is dead as I walk into class!! It's ridiculous, I'd have better luck getting a walkie talkie?!Overall: Okay my dad did not pay the price listed above, he paid $150-$200. Which really makes me madder because  it's not worth that much (which isn't much)! Please save your money and get another phone on another network (That's what I'm doing) if you are phone savvy, a social networker, or have had a phone that came after the stone age!!YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!

I need a replacement  or I need my money back. This is just purely a  highway robbery. Not happy at all.

I purchased this phone on Oct. 18th 2012.I payed $155 for it. Within FOUR months it started breaking down. First i noticed that everytime i would try to save a contact,  when i went back to look for the contact and it wasnt even there. Everytime i type it types extra slow, i have to press hard on the key pad. The battery is horrible, when i go to work my phone is fully charged, by the time i get off work the phone is dead. Now the spring to the charger piece broke, i literally have to hold the changer in place the whole time its charging.This phone is cheap, you dont get what you pay for, all you get is get ripped off.

I love the phone.  Only problem is the life of the battery.  Hope they come out with a better battery.  Has to be charged daily.

I've had this phone for a few months now. I've hated it since day 1. But Metro, being the lovely company it is, wouldn't let me do an exchange for a different phone. I have NO SPACE on my phone. I have a 32gig SD card, with plenty of room on it... But the internal memory is S***, too. I can't download too many apps, and the few that I have I can't update anymore because there's no internal memory room. It does not MATTER that I have moved every single thing possible to the SD card, it has done NOTHING for me! The camera takes so-so pictures, but most of the time there is a yellowish color to my pictures, outside and inside. Sound quality on calls is ok, but most of the time I have to sit in a certain position to maintain a phone call. I don't get all of my notifications. I have never been so fed up with a phone in my life! It's just another S*** phone from a s*** company.

i purchased this online from Amazon. went to activate it at the store n it was stolen/lost property. i was pissed. be careful what u buy..

I haven't had this phone a good 6 months and I'm already having major issues.  First it was freezing and now it will not charge at all.  I bought a new charger and battery.  The phone was working for 7 hours, then it went completely dead and now it will not charge at all.  If you are thinking about purchasing this phone, DON'T DO IT!!!!!!

I would not recommend this phone. First off it takes forever to get your rebate, second off if you are a texter you should not purchase this phone. I text a lot and it is SUPER slow, I constantly change my keyboard hoping it will get faster. The camera completely blinds you! And the picture doesn't come out right because of the flash being so bright. Internet is slow, takes forever to loud on apps. If your not on your phone much then maybe this is the phone for you, but if you use your phone a lot, then you shouldn't reconsider this phone.

I got this phone as a gift, it was the phone I wanted. I had an lg phone for less than a year and it stopped doing everything it was supposed to (web, text, sd card went bad, battery went bad), except for spotty calls.Then I got the coolpad. it is the best. the buttons are a little more sensitive than I thought they would be, but I am okay with that. Got a larger sd card, takes great pics......this is a really great phone for not a bad price.I highly reccomend it.

I gave it a second star cause it does everything when it's on it's pretty good. the only problem: it's never on. i can't keep this phone charged because either the battery, the charger or the outlet is broken. I've only had this phone for 2 months. What a waste. My phone's dead right now. It's been dead for 2 days now.

all the bad things thats been said are true !! i was checking to see was anyone else having issues with this phn n  i stubbled across this site!! as i was reading these reviews it shut off and now my phne wont even come on yall!! lmao!! we got suckered with this one!! smh!!

Its a good phone i got it on Christmas eve its good it does frees at all. it only has a horrible camera

I don't understand the negative reviews at all. I got this phone for $79, and for a 4G smartphone with Mobile Hostspot capability, that's a great bargain. This phone is faster than my 7" tablet with similar specs. Plunk in a 16 Gb or 32 Gb microSD card and this can do everything. I use Amazon App Store for all my apps (I don't personally like how instrusive Google is) and installed Netflix, Pandora, WinAmp, Sky.FM and MoboPlayer apps, along with some games.Everything works great, but the MoboPlayer must be run in "software" mode (i.e. soft-decoding), however, because the default video player in the Quattro does not play most video formats (only the MoboPlayer works for me).There is no built-in equalizer for playing music, so you'll have to find an equalizer app as well if that is important to you.There is a mini-USB plug that doubles as a charger and a USB port for transferring files from your computer to the microSD card. No problems here.The device has both 3G/4G as well as wireless and Bluetooth capability. I have an unlimited data plan, but my speeds are better over my home wireless network, so I'm happy to switch back and forth.The headphone jack is a 3.5 inch standard size, not the mini 2.5 inch, so I can use it with regular headphones (including the ones with a mic).There are cameras on both sides, so conceivably this can be used with Skype. I have not tried that, yet, though. There is no auto-focus or exposure-control, however, so don't expect quality pics or videos (it will take both).The 4" screen is very clear, both while watching Netflix and watching videos (using MoboPlayer). I have no complaints at all on that score.As to battery life, I extend it by turning off the GPS when I don't need it as well asd the wireless and Bluetooth, disabling a lot of useless background apps, turning down the screen brightness, and some other tweaks. All that stuff chews up power, after all.Overall I can not complain about this phone at all. We have 4 and everyone has ditched their (admittedly low-end) tablets for this. It's just more convenient.

When I first purchesed this phone I was wondering how good this phone really is?  Since I only payed 130.00 dollars at metro pcs and have a mail in rebate of 50.00 dollars . Meaning this phone really cost me only 80.00 dollars . Well everything on this phone works great.  I have already downloaded 100 movies on a 16gb card. This phone is great for suffing the internet . It is quick to movie from job to job and I see no real slowness in the processer infact it is fast.  I have owned this phone about 2 months now and.love it . The screen is 4 inches a 480 by 800 pixel count and is very clear display for watching movies . I have tryed a lot of other phones a lot more expensive and really can not tell much of a difference .

Bought this to replace a similar phone. It worked fine at first, but after a few weeks started acting up and had to get it replaced. Its probably not the fault of the vendor since there is no way to tell if a working phone will go bad. Would buy another model in the future.

I only had the phone less than 5 months and not only is the phone is horrible but the battery is too. The phone is very slow (internet, texting, etc) and it constantly freezes on you too. The battery goes from 0% to 50% in 5 minutes and it takes too long to download apps music and videos. I will not recommand this phone to anybody. Not even to my worst enemy.

Here's a rooting guide [...]I've had this phone for 5 years ish  or so, and it's starting to finally go onto its hind legs.Perks:Durable! I've dropped it a few times in the past. Never hard a cracked display, or battery issues. The battery would always come out if I dropped it so it never became swollen or anything. :)Rootable to get rid of the bulk ware, I guess that's a perk?Never had to replace the battery, never had any network issues beside the getting text messages hours/day late. Never had any SIM / SD card issues.Easy to flash or restore to factory settings.Really easy keyboard to grasp with either the stock Gingerbreak (Android) keyboard which is super responsive, but I use the GoogleFlex keyboard so can use Swype.Camera application does not crash and syncs with dropbox so you can upload it automatically.__________________________________________________________________Main complaints: (BASED ON STOCK OS, not Root)Bad phone camera quality.Gingerbread 4.2 - It's great but I've had to deal with "LOW STORAGE SPACE" when I just had 2 applications installed (Dolphin & Battery Saver) until I nuked the bloatware.  (After just doing a fresh install I have 160 MB internal storage)Yes you have the ability to install an SD card and move Apps to an SD card, but it doesn't move the actual application to the SD. Just the cache or something, so you still have 12-20 mb worth of the application on your phone.Software: Unable to sync up ANY applications including email, google drive, Google Talk (Hangouts) dropbox, unless you clear up some space.Bad battery life by stock - Even after the advertised 8 hours, in reality when you leave it idling with Wifi Off and Bluetooth off  and reduced brightness it always lasted about 3 or 5.  Download GO Battery Saver &Power; Widget or Battery Saver, this will become a NECESSITY to actually keep that actual 8 hour battery life.Charging: The port is TERRIBLE. After a few weeks the charger always started feeling a little loose, and I'd have to wiggle it into place. Now I have to strap it upside down to actually get it to charge.IF YOU SEE ANY GLITCHES JUST SET IT BACK TO FACTORY SETTINGS AND MAKE SURE YOUR DATAS BACKED UP.Issues that's fixed:**Battery drains quickly, restarting the phone will remove 30% of battery or more. (can sometimes show 100% to 1-2% within minutes)**Unresponsive Touchscreen.**Unable to mount SD card**Settings application crashes. Everything just crashes.**texting app freezes loading messages.I've had OK call quality, but my phone would hang up on people, it stopped recognizing SD cards, and now the power button doesn't even work half the time. Coolpad cannot even locate my serial number anymore, so I'm giving up on this phone.

This phone just wasnt what i thought it would be the camera sucks and the texting is so slow i wasted my money on it big time also the battery life is no good!

i just got this phone about a week ago and i love it so far because i change the launcher and i set up this Phone like my previous phone

Got the phone aNd could not connect it due to bad esn. This hone waa very low budget! Not what i expected.  Great for a child.

Nice phone and it was easy to start phone service. The phone came with everything it needs for one to work with it.

i have the cool pad. right now im on my kindle. why? because my coolpad died WHILE ON THE CHARGER.  the coolpad will MAYBE last 4 hours with 100% percent charged. oh dont even try to dowload more that 4 apps because thats all i have.  i also have 14 pictures. also your 4G with come in and out every two seconds.  the cool pads suck save your money for something better please.

My sister purchase the coolpad quattro a month ago, sad to say the Sim card went bad. She has gone to two metro pcs corporate store for a replacement card with no success. She was told by an metro representative that there are no Sim card to replace in those phones. She has called the maker of the phone(coolpad) they refuse to assisted her. Not happy with this purchase at all!!!. My sister have to go purchase another phone. She told coolpad that she will be contacting the Better Business Bureau,  they did not care.

This phone's battery life is just horrible, I paid 150 for this piece of junk and I so regret it, I wonder if metro pcs honors the warranty; maybe I should try that. Please don't buy this piece of junk and also not here on amazon, go to metro pcs website and its like half the price.

Beware this phone is horrible the app store has been laoding for over 2 hours I cant download any apps. This phone is garbage.

Stay away from this turkey. Yes, it's less expensive than other 4G phones out there, but you get what you pay for. Here are just a few of the things I like least:- Battery life: Most of the time I get less than 8 hours of standby time out of a charge. That's with everything turned off except GPS (which comes right back on if I try and turn it off.) If I'm actually using it (i.e. talking or even playing game of solitare) I can run the battery completely down in less than 1 hour.- Dialing. Making calls from the contact list works as expected. If I try putting a number in from the keypad more than half the time I get the message "The process android.process.acore has stopped unexpectedly. Please try again." It can take more than 8 tries before I can actually put in a number and make a call.- Memory. Want to download a bunch of apps? Forget it. You'll run out of memory. Even with a SD card, some apps simply won't install to it. There's several apps I'd like to run but can't.- Camera. Camera is adequate, but that's all. I haven't tried to record video.I've finally had enough. Tomorrow I'm going to the MetroPCS store and getting the LG Motion.

I purchased this phone a little over 2 months ago and since then I have had nothing but trouble with it! It's had to be reset by the company 3 times. It shuts down at the most random and inconvenient times, and I stopped being able to receive my text messages. After waiting for 3 weeks the problem was finally fixed, but now the apps won't load and the phone keeps flashing a "Sorry!" message about needed to force close and restart. this phone is a piece of CRAP! Actually this company as a whole is crap! I had a Verizon for 8 yrs and never had any trouble with it! I curse the day I switched over to MetroPCS. Save yourself the stress and don't even bother reconsidering this phone. If I could give it negative stars then I would but unfortunately I can't.

It's really not a bad phone. I paid $79 after rebate. I've had this phone for about 10 months now and haven't had any problems. Screen size is nice but video and camera could be better. Slow processor at times and battery life is poor. Overall it's a nice phone and for $79 dollars what more can you expect? People that have high priced phones have similar problems as well. I plan on keeping this phone for a long time and hope this review helps.

Okok....see I'm not the type to listen to listen To she&he say...but when it comes to my cash then yasssss...There more Gudd reviews then bass..I just want it to take pics ad be on fb with dats it doe..its jus temporary untill I get my iPhone...I just pray it do wat it says since I bought the new one for $50.....feel me..anyways I will come bck with my real LOYAL. REVIEW ...lets give it sometime cuz u cnt judge something ova nite...rrrr IJS..YEAH

Do not buy this phone. I recently bought this phone one week ago. It's extremely slow. It freezes up all the time. It drops your calls. I mean i can't name enough of why this phone is such a bad phone. It also takes a long time before it boots up. I am in the market of looking for another phone, as I can't stand how slow and crappy this phone is. I thought I could take the slowness of it but I can't take the freezing up, that I can't handle.

This was a good deal to find a barely used, awesome phone. I read great reviews and this price was way too good to overlook. Nto much space on it though, definitely need to purchase more on a card or whatever.

Phone has a few issues.. It tends to freeze a lot and kicks me off certain apps. The battery life definitely needs improvement.

I have 4 of this phones and so far so good. I bought them on sale from Metropcs. I paid around $75 each after rebate. This a 4G phone that handles videos, music, skype, youtube and whatever task o app I throw at it. I have not had any issues whatsoever with this phone and remember...I have 4 of them.

I love the phone its practically brand new it came with a free phone case a charger.  It works great ill be ordering from you guys again.

My friend bought this phone and it's a piece of crap.  Not to mention it's oversized, cannot fit into a pocket (where he normally carries his phone) the voice to text says random incriminating and derogatory words (even when he speaks slowly).  Battery doesn't retain a charge, and drains after about an hour or two of use (phone can be idle and battery still drains).  NEVER buy a phone that has the carrier name on the front instead of the manufacturer's name.  My friend who works at Metro PCS told me they are prototypes for consumer testing, and a dead giveaway that the phone is a POS is that they stop selling them as soon as the store inventory is depleted.  Dish out the few extra dollars for a tried and true phone not a prototype.

When I first got my phone, it worked wonderfully.  Everythings was crisp and clean and fast....that lasted maybe 2 weeks.  I figured it was slowing down because of all my contacts and the pictures,apps, etc.  Then as has been mentioned my battery life would just disappear, incredibly when I was not using it.  I noticed the charging was weird too, sometimes quickly, other times slowly.  Okay so the latest complaint, oh yeah and did I also mention that the flash is entirely too bright....like bright white light in your picture?  Okay back to the today complaint.  Turned the camera on took one pic, sat the cellphone down...dottled around for a about 20 minutes...generally the camera would turn itself off return to the home screen.  Well this time is went to a "green screen" would not return.  Unfortunately I have it on a lock system inwhich I have to unlock my phone to use it, but as mentioned there is a "green screen" and it does not come up to the lock screen, just stays green.  After hearing how Metropcs does not care about its customers, I am nothing but dismayed and upset.  Wah!!!!

this phone sucks ass! i've had this phone for at least 6 months. The first couple of weeks it was working fine but now its like UGHHH! the keypad is really slow, you have to press on a letter like 3 times sometimes. this phone freezes ALOT, the internet is really slow. Oh & when i try to press on something it goes to another thing i didnt wanna press on. this phone resends old messages by itself because people are always texting me "huh? " "what?" . Phone dies fast, i charge it in the morning before going to school, afterschool, & about twice at night. Front camera sucks too. I seriously dont recommend this phone. I've been wanting the iphone 4s from virgin mobile $450 hopefully i get it soon :)

People today have found different ways to consume throughout the internet. Amazon has been one of the most used website to shop online. Most of the things people buy in local stores can now be found in Amazon.com. As a fellow online shopper there are many things you can buy like electronics, clothe, toys, kitchen ware, and more. The item I have recently bought is my cell phone called the CoolPad 4G LTE and it has been one of the best items I have bought online.Buying my cell phone online was one of the best choices I made. My cell phone has changed my life since the moment got it. A cell phone for many teens is a part of our lives and stands for us growing up. When my parents gave me my cell phone it was a time changing experience. Automatically I had the world at my finger tips I could talk to anyone or explore the internet at any time I wanted. My cell phone changed my entire life I was able to communicate with all my friends in minutes and talk as long as I wanted and even talk to family members that were far away. This cell phone changed my life being a teenager and having this experience was the best I highly recommend it for people and give it 5 stars.When I bought my cell phone I was not only looking for the ways it could change my ways of communicating but also its features. The Cool Pad has many different features that make it great. The life of the battery is very long lasting and charges fast when being in a hurry all you need is a few minutes. The screen is very durable and wide which helps for those who like to have everything spread out or even space to txt. Like all cell phones the memory is very good and holds many pictures and apps like games or entertainment. The one thing I cared the most about was that the internet was very good and fast which helped when it came to needing help in homework or a last minute study session.There are many fun and interesting things on the Cool Pad and it can be a life changing experience. It has helped me in many ways but comparing to other people who have had to change their cell phones often I haven't which I believe is important. My cell phone has been with me for over 3 years and I haven't changed it once. I have dropped it a few times but yet it keeps working very well and resisted being handled by my 5 year old brother which says a lot. There are a lot people who have the newest thing and in a few months getting a new phone because the phone screen broke or they dropped it and it doesn't function right. Having my cell phone for almost 3 years says the durable the phone is. Many people in my high school started having the same phone and was even seen as much as the iphone and was as popular.The Cool Pad has done a lot for my life especially in three years it has helped me connect with people I love and people I would like to meet. It has also helped me save money since I haven't had the need to change my phone to the newest thing. Having a cell phone can really help change a teenager's life. My Cool Pad is the best cell phone I have ever had, as every other person I did want the iphone or even the Galaxy but once I had my cell phone it was like having both of the phones without the expenses. Amazon has been the place to shop since I could remember and being able to buy a cell phone. The Cool pad has been the best thing I have a bought on Amazon and haven't regretted it since. I recommend the Cool Pad to all people of all ages. The phone you spend on this cell phone will be worth it.

This phone is extremely overpriced for what you get. my cheaper phone took higher quality video and pics. the battery life is terrible! it freezes constantly. There is a bug in the charging outlet in the phone. The battery seems to go from zero to 40% in 5min. its a glitch. this is my second phone with the same charger and there has to be an issue with them. after day 2 with this charger i was already having to angle the charger just right to get it to work. very frustrating. i regret the purchase of this phone and was talked into it by a sales girl. hooefully one day i will see that 50$ rebate i turned in but doubtful. so please beware. this phone is a ripoff

This ph is horrible since day one buttons get stuck,memory sux,i bought 16 memory card and ph stills reads short storage. i will be in middle of txting and it will freeze and as i said before buttons freezes and only way it will unfreeze is to hit the lock buttom on and off, cant download certain apps.

I am very happy with my cell, and may buy an extra one, it w as quick to easy, new in close package,
